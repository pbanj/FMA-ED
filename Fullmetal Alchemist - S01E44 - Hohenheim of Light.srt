1
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,370
Something wrong?

2
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,930
I was just hoping that
the others got away safely.

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:17,670
Throughout the East, there are many
towns of diversified cultures to blend in with.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:18,868
I'm sure they headed there.

5
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:23,290
You, however, are considered
responsible for the revolt in Lior.

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,650
They'll be looking for you.

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,750
It... It looks like a
temple of our god, Leto.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,110
It belongs to a far
more ancient religion.

9
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:37,650
One that was abandoned long ago.

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,000
They recognized only one god,
banning all other beliefs as heresy.

11
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,220
It seems they had
quite a following.

12
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,940
Because of their intolerance,
a great many people died.

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,040
How terrible.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,780
Religion exists to save us.

15
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,020
That's what happens when
people try to become god.

16
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,800
Hush.

17
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,280
Hush now, my darling.

18
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,843
We're fine.

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,780
Don't worry.

20
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,240
Why did you let those two go?

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,120
I believe taking care of those two
brothers was your duty now, wasn't it, sloth?

22
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,480
Yours and Wrath's, that is.

23
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,400
Don't worry, I will.

24
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:49,280
But we didn't go against the
direct orders of our master.

25
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,800
I thought that you of all people
would understand my reasons.

26
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,880
I do understand.

27
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,720
You wish to be human.

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,620
You think you're the only one?

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,120
We were all born
with that goal in mind.

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,620
They have arrived.

31
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,530
The Philosopher's Stone.

32
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:31,490
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange in alchemy.

33
00:02:32,891 --> 00:02:34,310
They gain without sacrifice.

34
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,830
Create without equal exchange.

35
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:42,250
We searched for
it, and we found it.

36
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
Now why the hell did you two run
away without asking for my help first?

37
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,380
Tell us, boys, please.

38
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,460
What happened?

39
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,480
Führer King Bradley
is a Homunculus.

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,660
When you say the word Homunculus,
you mean an artificial human?

41
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,800
Yes.

42
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,200
They're after the
Philosopher's Stone.

43
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,820
And they're pulling all
the strings in the Military.

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,800
That can't be true.

45
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,860
The Führer had no idea about the
experiments going on in Laboratory Five.

46
00:05:09,861 --> 00:05:12,880
The Military was being
infiltrated without his knowledge.

47
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,500
He had the Mark
of the Ouroboros.

48
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,680
I saw it myself.

49
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,740
What else do you
think that could mean?

50
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,700
You told us about a Homunculus
with the ability to shapeshift.

51
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,980
The Führer's secretary
is Homunculus, too.

52
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,460
I thought she was an alien.

53
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,840
If that's true, and the Führer and Ms.
Douglas are Homunculi inside the Military,

54
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,340
what purpose do they serve?

55
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,140
What is it they hope to gain?

56
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,900
Do you want me to
keep them busy, sir?

57
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,740
Take them back home?

58
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,414
Not through Lior.

59
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,740
I could produce false information to
keep attention away from Central for a while.

60
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,460
Do it.

61
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,600
Catch up later.

62
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,100
You'll go to Resembool?

63
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,460
Men, our mission is complete.

64
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,140
We can return with
our heads held high.

65
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,391
But aren't you supposed to
keep an eye on the Colonel?

66
00:05:59,415 --> 00:06:02,920
Do you doubt the integrity of a
man whose muscles can do this?

67
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,440
No, Major.

68
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,320
That's not it.

69
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,640
I'll show you what they can do!

70
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
Breda, is Havok okay?

71
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,800
Uh-uh.

72
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,620
He's gone.

73
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,680
Sent back before us with fury.

74
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,200
I'm glad.

75
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:24,640
I didn't mean to hurt him.

76
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,420
Ed, where's your watch?

77
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:31,660
I see.

78
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,740
So you've already taken
off your pocket watch.

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,860
You must have really meant what
you said about retiring from the Military.

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,360
I didn't take it off
to prove a point.

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
Archer took it from me,
and I never got it back.

82
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:42,120
What?

83
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,340
But we told Al to
give it back to you.

84
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,900
I'm sorry, brother.

85
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,080
It's gone.

86
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,500
You lost it?

87
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,220
No, I didn't lose it.

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,440
See?

89
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,740
Kimbley threw it at Scar, and then
all the red stones fell out of it.

90
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,160
And Scar's arm absorbed it.

91
00:06:57,205 --> 00:06:58,320
There was nothing I could do.

92
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,920
And why were there red stones
inside my state-issued watch, Al?

93
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,080
It's Archer.

94
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,440
He uses that trick to create
more alchemy-amplifying devices.

95
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,440
What?

96
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,780
When we were crushing the Ishbalan
Rebellion, Grand ordered us to do the same thing.

97
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,020
Wait a minute, Colonel.

98
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:17,360
You're saying that even though you
knew the Military had made a partial

99
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,380
Philosopher's Stone, you waited
until now to tell me about it?

100
00:07:20,845 --> 00:07:23,880
I thought Dr. Marcoh had run
away and put a stop to the research.

101
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,460
I had no way of knowing they were
using human beings to... I don't trust you.

102
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,360
Brother!

103
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,140
You knew what it
took to make one.

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,736
And still... Stop it, brother!

105
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,076
You let me search
for that damn thing?

106
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,660
That's enough!

107
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,108
Brother!

108
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,240
Ah!

109
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,160
Al!

110
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,455
He can't go in the water.

111
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,214
Al!!

112
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,379
Al!!!!

113
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,950
Right here!

114
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,656
Brother look, I can swim!

115
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,420
I can swim!

116
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,260
You idiot!

117
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,640
I thought that blood seal of yours would
wash away if you ever let it get too wet.

118
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,540
Yeah.

119
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,660
Looks like we don't have
to worry about that anymore.

120
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,360
I guess it's cause of the
Philosopher's Stone, huh?

121
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,120
I don't know what
you're talking about.

122
00:08:30,121 --> 00:08:30,600
Okay.
Okay.

123
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,140
I get it!

124
00:08:31,141 --> 00:08:31,800
Put it back on!

125
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,460
What's that?

126
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,240
That glowing...

127
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,040
Oh!

128
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,520
Nothing!

129
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:39,020
Alphonse, what's because
of the Philosopher's Stone?

130
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:39,980
Ah, nothing!

131
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,620
Just a little inside joke.

132
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,000
Okay, let's go!

133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:43,740
Brother!

134
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,820
Wait for me!

135
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,150
Wow, looks like the Military
hasn't arrived just yet.

136
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:56,450
Wait a minute.

137
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,336
That's Sergeant Bloch.

138
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,370
Is he...

139
00:08:58,370 --> 00:08:59,010
No! No! No! No!

140
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:00,090
He's not after Ed and Al!

141
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,170
He's okay, I promise!

142
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,610
Sergeant Bloch!

143
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,621
Hey, what's the matter with you?

144
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:09,930
Lieutenant Ross!

145
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,150
Lieutenant Ross!

146
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,200
A long time ago I saw an eagle
with wings as black as obsidian.

147
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,380
Your hair is the
exact same color.

148
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:23,460
I never thought
I'd see it again.

149
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,820
Thank you for bringing such a
beautiful memory back to me.

150
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,980
And thank you.

151
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,620
What a lovely thing to say.

152
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,936
See, she's falling for
it, hook, line and sinker!

153
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,580
Don't we have
bigger concerns now?

154
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,660
Bigger than love?

155
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:39,020
There's something
about that guy.

156
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:41,720
He seems familiar,
doesn't he, brother?

157
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:42,780
Brother?

158
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,950
What the hell are
you doing flirting?

159
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:49,860
Edward, what the...

160
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,500
You're gone for over ten years
and I come back home to that?

161
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,860
Damn you, old man!

162
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:57,660
Dad?

163
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,380
I remember him
from the pictures.

164
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,280
Dad!

165
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,320
He's home!

166
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,180
Dad's home!

167
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:28,060
I..I know you might not be able to tell
who I am because of the way I look, but...

168
00:10:28,123 --> 00:10:30,340
Alphonse, you've certainly got tall.

169
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,260
How did you know it was me?

170
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:36,740
Edward...

171
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,385
So, do you still
hate drinking milk?

172
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,940
Who are you calling a micro sized half pint
who didn't grow up because he doesn't drink milk?

173
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,551
That's not what he said, Edward.

174
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,620
Are you still mad, Edward?

175
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:51,680
Who ever said I was mad?

176
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,316
There's nothing to be mad about.

177
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,240
I was just having a polite
conversation with that man, nothing else.

178
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:56,918
Is that clear?

179
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,618
You sure look like
you were enjoying it.

180
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,240
Oh, it was just the
Cologne he was wearing.

181
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,800
You never smell anything
like that in the Military.

182
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:06,080
No soldier I know
ever wears Cologne.

183
00:11:06,665 --> 00:11:09,520
Maybe the soldiers you know don't
want to smell like flowery sissy boys.

184
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,500
And just what's the
matter with you anyway?

185
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
I hate his smell.

186
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,160
I still remember it from
when I was a little kid.

187
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,640
When Al was born, Dad left the
house to do some kind of research.

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,820
At least that's what Mom said.

189
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,060
But we never got any letters.

190
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,360
So eventually I caught on.

191
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,620
I could still smell that scent all
over the house when he was gone.

192
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,100
It never completely went away.

193
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,640
It's funny.

194
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,020
When I saw Lyra in
Lior, I smelled it again.

195
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,980
You saw Lyra in Lior?

196
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,360
So she got out of
Dante's place safely.

197
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,500
That's great.

198
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:47,754
Hey!

199
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,120
Hold on a minute.

200
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,380
Who is Lyra?

201
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,800
And how do you two know her?

202
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,660
You can't keep
talking around us.

203
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,507
- I'm sorry. 
Why do you have to know everything?

204
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,680
Don't get mad at me. I'm just
tired of being kept in the dark.

205
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,039
- I'm so sorry.
Can you guys just stop yelling.

206
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,480
Come on!
You always do this to me.

207
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,578
You never tell me anything.

208
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,570
The Führer has been
accused of treason.

209
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:12,330
Your children have as well.

210
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:15,910
But honestly, I'm more interested
in discussing the pictures I've seen of you.

211
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,470
When a Homunculus is born,
it doesn't have a human shape.

212
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,310
It never would if left alone.

213
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:26,730
The only way for them to obtain one is to be
fed sufficient amounts of a vital energy source.

214
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,490
Shards of the stone.

215
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:32,085
You mean they have
to feed on human lives?

216
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,230
They may start out like innocent children, but
in time their desires and powers corrupt them.

217
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,050
You can't trust anyone
who lives that long.

218
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:42,290
No one.

219
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,530
It's important you
remember that fact.

220
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,330
Right.

221
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,650
I'll keep that in mind.

222
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,610
You said stone fragments
were created in Laboratory Five.

223
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,910
Homunculi can't perform alchemy,
yet how are they able to teach it?

224
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,230
And what purpose
would it serve them?

225
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,770
There's someone else.

226
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:04,450
Someone who's
controlling all their actions.

227
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:05,870
Oh well.

228
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:09,910
Even if they are Homunculi,
this country's great.

229
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:13,950
The Military's still as honest and
powerful as it's always been, right?

230
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,633
I'm sure there's
nothing to worry about.

231
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,250
Dad?

232
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:22,730
Why is it that Homunculi
can't use alchemy?

233
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,930
It's because all of them
come from beyond the Gate.

234
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,150
But let's not talk of that.

235
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,670
Tell me about Trisha.

236
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,010
Or about you boys.

237
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,400
I want to know what my sons
have been up to while I was away.

238
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,390
Dad...

239
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:41,810
By looking at your body... I can
guess that... There's not much to tell.

240
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:46,950
We failed a transmutation
and I lost my limbs.

241
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:49,110
Al lost his body.

242
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,570
That's all.

243
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:54,090
But Edward... Alchemy isn't
something you can... Shut up!

244
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,990
You just can't show up here
and start acting like a father!

245
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:59,590
Not when we had to
watch Mom die without you.

246
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,590
Come on, Al.

247
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:02,630
Brother!

248
00:14:04,935 --> 00:14:06,470
Brother, I'm staying with him.

249
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,730
But Al... Let's go, Dad.

250
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:25,462
I wonder if we'll be able to restore my
body to normal with the Philosopher's Stone.

251
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:30,290
By using the Philosopher's Stone, you'll be
able to attach your soul to someone else's body.

252
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,950
Someone else's?

253
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,410
That's not what I want.

254
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,450
I'm afraid your body was lost.

255
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,590
In accordance with
equivalent exchange.

256
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,090
But by sacrificing your body, you
must have gained something else.

257
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:44,910
Gained something?

258
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:48,190
What we gain is
not always wanted.

259
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,570
If you returned everything you made,
perhaps you could have your body back.

260
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,910
Then, if I could defeat
that Homunculus...

261
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,390
Uh, nothing, nothing!

262
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,130
I'm just so happy
you're home, Dad.

263
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,670
Oh, I have another
question for you.

264
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,190
Yes?

265
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:21,150
Dad?

266
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,690
If I'd have known he was going to leave
this early, I would have beat him up yesterday.

267
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,230
I'm not kidding, brother!

268
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:30,770
Let's go find him, now!

269
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:31,850
Take it from me, Al.

270
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,150
He's long gone by now.

271
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:33,670
Fine!

272
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:34,910
Then I'll go alone!

273
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:36,850
Wait!

274
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,470
Neither of you will be
leaving here for a little while.

275
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:44,390
We got a call from Sergeant
Fallman at the station.

276
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,610
The investigation
group has arrived.

277
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,290
We're going to
redirect them to Central.

278
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,530
You sure that's smart?

279
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:52,230
Covering for a
couple of fugitives?

280
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,350
I don't fully believe
your story yet, Elric.

281
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,130
So I intend to find out the truth about the
Führer's connection with all of this on my own.

282
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:04,130
And if you found out that
everything Edward said was true?

283
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,880
Well, now...

284
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,880
I think we should put you in the
basement until it's safe to come out of hiding.

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,440
No need for that!

286
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,400
You too, girl.

287
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,660
Brother, where do
you think Dad went?

288
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,380
Will you shut up about that?

289
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:54,180
What I want to know is how the Colonel is planning to
check on the truth about the Führer and that woman.

290
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,020
Yeah.

291
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:00,489
That secretary can't have been in the
Military for more than four years, though.

292
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,720
I know.

293
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:07,080
Um... if you're talking about Juliet Douglas,
she's been in the Military for almost 14 years.

294
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,980
That's impossible, Sheska.

295
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,020
It's not impossible.

296
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,780
I mean, I happen to know that she was
the main cause of the whole war in Ishbal.

297
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,540
Oh, you mean that story about
a soldier who shot down a kid?

298
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:19,200
That's a lie.

299
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,940
The real cause was a covert
special ops division of the Military.

300
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,620
It was started on purpose.

301
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:38,093
That can't be.

302
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:45,110
I get it. They made the war for
the Ishbalan Philosopher's Stone.

303
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:47,150
That must be the reason.

304
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:48,910
Ingredients.

305
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:53,770
So that someone might create the
Philosopher's Stone using the Grand Arcanum.

306
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,350
They'd go that far?

307
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:59,370
The whole thing was
designed by those Homunculi.

308
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,450
So that's it.

309
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,910
Hughes must have
figured out that much.

310
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:06,190
And that's why they killed him.

311
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,710
I'll kill that bastard
with my own hands!

312
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,470
Wait, Ed!

313
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,190
Ed, what's wrong?

314
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:12,890
Let me go!

315
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,650
It happened right
after we left central!

316
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:18,350
Those Military
jackasses didn't tell us!

317
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,410
Did you know?

318
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:21,710
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,550
I've known about it for a
little while now, Edward.

320
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,910
There's nothing you can do!

321
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,798
Come back downstairs!

322
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,030
You've got to be kidding me!

323
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,112
If Hughes got killed, then it was our
fault for putting him in that situation!

324
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,510
He was our friend!

325
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,310
When are you going to grow up?

326
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:42,310
Colonel Mustang didn't keep you in
the dark out of malice, you morons!

327
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,050
I've heard about
this Hughes guy.

328
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,150
It sounds like he
was a great man.

329
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:54,070
But Mustang doesn't want you to
be driven by thoughts of revenge.

330
00:18:54,071 --> 00:18:58,910
He wants you to realize that there
are more important things in life.

331
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,650
I bet your friend Hughes
would have agreed.

332
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:08,510
Yeah, but... I was... I was
wrong about him all that time.

333
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:13,310
I thought the Colonel didn't care about
Hughes at all, that he was out for himself.

334
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,230
But what... but what if he...

335
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:20,110
...he's determined to
become a great man?

336
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,830
Because he promised
Hughes he would.

337
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:26,810
So he forces himself to
search for the right path.

338
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:29,630
Not to be taken in by
thoughts of revenge.

339
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,050
He's an adult to look up to.

340
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,850
And why not revenge?

341
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,530
When someone close to you is
killed and you know who's behind it...

342
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:40,850
...how can there be anything
more important to you than revenge?

343
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:44,310
If that's being an adult,
then I'm never growing up!

344
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,262
You grew up when you made the
decision to become a dog of the Military.

345
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,830
That bastard...

346
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,603
From now on, I hate him.

347
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:56,250
Someone's coming, Lust!

348
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,610
Don't worry, Gluttony.

349
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,930
This place is...

350
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:07,090
Who's that?

351
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,220
I welcome you here, sir.

352
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:15,460
Unfortunately, my master is out.

353
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:19,840
So... Lyra is this
body's name, is it?

354
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:23,100
I'm impressed you know that
much, my Hohenheim of Light.

355
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:26,780
It's nice to know you've been
thinking about me while you were away.

356
00:20:27,781 --> 00:20:30,500
I heard the name
Lyra from my sons.

357
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,320
But even if I hadn't,
it's fairly obvious.

358
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,660
You can't hide your smell.

359
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,840
Have you come with noble
aspirations to save me?

360
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,220
No.

361
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,360
Not this time, Dante.

362
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,460
Gluttony!

363
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,460
Scary!

364
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,500
Another alchemist
who doesn't need circles.

365
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,240
There's no need to
be worried, Gluttony.

366
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,040
He's spent too much time
in that body he's wearing.

367
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,300
I'm sure he's worn out.

368
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:18,260
Indeed i am worn out. But that means that
you're feeling your years as well, aren't you?

369
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:27,460
You may hide your decaying body with
clothes, but that masking scent betrays your lie.

370
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,840
Like you, Hohenheim?

371
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:33,860
Dante, I want you to stop using my
sons as pawns in your malicious game.

372
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,380
In exchange for that promise, I will tell
you the reason your new body is rotting, too.

373
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:46,430
Well, it looks like they
managed to turn the Military back.

374
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,290
Yeah, I guess so.

375
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,650
Hey, where's Edward?

376
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,950
He said there was
something he had to do alone.

377
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,950
Sory... I'm sorry... mom...

378
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,675
Fullmetal Alchemist

379
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,760
Episode 45,
A rotted heart.

380
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:44,880
Al.

381
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,358
I'm going to fight them all.

382
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:49,927
You don't have to do anything anymore.
