1
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:15,030
Well, we're here.

2
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:16,710
Yeah.

3
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,850
What's the matter?

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,250
What do you think is the matter?

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,110
Once again I'll have to listen to
Colonel's sarcasm.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,370
Tell me how I screwed up.

7
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,710
Struck out on the Philosopher's Stone
again, huh?

8
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,530
How am I supposed to keep funding this
goose chase?

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:33,630
Money doesn't grow on trees there,
Chief.

10
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,690
Ed, where'd you run off to?

11
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,370
Oh, wait, there you are.

12
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:39,610
I couldn't see you there beyond my
paperwork.

13
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:41,830
Seeing as how you're so short and all.

14
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:43,670
Ha ha ha ha ha!

15
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,930
I know.

16
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:50,730
We're already here, so I might as well get
the verbal abuse over with.

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,910
Let's go, Al.

18
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,910
Hey, Al?

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:58,930
Al!

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,530
Coming, brother.

21
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,270
What are you up to?

22
00:01:07,410 --> 00:01:10,015
AHHHHHHHH!

23
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,063
Huh?

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,553
What was that?

25
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,947
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

26
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,694
To obtain something of equal value must be
lost.

27
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:25,040
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

28
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,500
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

29
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:20,008
Fullmetal VS Flame.

30
00:03:21,263 --> 00:03:23,490
AHHHHHHHH!

31
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:26,370
What's the problem, Breda?

32
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,090
Havoc!

33
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,750
Be careful!

34
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:28,910
It's on the loose!

35
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,430
There's nothing protecting us!

36
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:30,970
Over there!

37
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,090
Over there!

38
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,010
Care to explain this one, Falman?

39
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,250
It is a dog, Lieutenant.

40
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,650
Carnivorous canine mammal.

41
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,670
I believe the scientific name is...
That's not what I'm asking, Falman.

42
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,730
You need to loosen up.

43
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:43,410
Yes, sir, Lieutenant Hawkeye.

44
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:44,750
I will continue to work on that.

45
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,390
Sorry, sirs.

46
00:03:47,391 --> 00:03:48,378
I found him this morning.

47
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,403
He was all on his own.

48
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,430
MSG fury.

49
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,290
So, you gonna keep him?

50
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,825
I wish I could, Lieutenant
Havoc, but as I'm sure you're

51
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:57,510
aware, there's no pets allowed
in the NCO living quarters.

52
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,750
Well, that certainly doesn't mean you can
keep him in the office, Kane.

53
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,970
I know it.

54
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,910
I just... he was shivering out in the rain
and I felt sorry for him.

55
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:06,970
Your higher-ups, you could keep him.

56
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,430
Not me.

57
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,550
I'm in the dorms, too.

58
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,430
No way!

59
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,010
I hate those beasts!

60
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:15,930
Don't worry.

61
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:17,226
I'll take him off your hands.

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,250
I like dogs.

63
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,670
Thank you, Lieutenant.

64
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,710
He's really sweet.

65
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,930
Sure.

66
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,530
I hear they're good when stir-fried.

67
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,650
A few spices...

68
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:26,670
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,710
Here in the East, they raise them as a
delicacy.

70
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:30,450
Especially these plumpets.

71
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,650
Let's try to find him a better owner,
okay?

72
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,910
Good plan.

73
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:35,450
Please.

74
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:36,510
It was a joke.

75
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,750
So, uh, should I come back later?

76
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,890
Hey, Edward, Alphonse, I guess this means
you're back.

77
00:04:47,397 --> 00:04:48,623
Meow

78
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,370
Strange.

79
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,710
Excuse me.

80
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,090
Al and I need to talk.

81
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,650
Edward, I believe you have a report to
make.

82
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:58,090
Thanks for the reminder, sir.

83
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,370
I'll speak to the Colonel now.

84
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,810
Al, be rational.

85
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,710
We don't have the means to care for it.

86
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,250
You can't just go picking up any stray you
see.

87
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,910
It's not any stray.

88
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,270
He called to me.

89
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,490
He's wet and hungry.

90
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,730
Can't we keep him?

91
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:13,570
No, Al.

92
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:15,290
Now go put it back where you found it.

93
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,550
I hate you, brother.

94
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,910
You're not even human.

95
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,150
Come on, Al.

96
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:24,690
Don't run.

97
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,810
Think of the kitten.

98
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,550
I know.

99
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,410
I am.

100
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,190
I'm the only one who is.

101
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,180
Wow, Ed.

102
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,360
You really have made some bang for our
buck.

103
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,600
Don't start with me, okay?

104
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,560
You're the one who told me to go to Lior
for a stone that turned out to be a fake.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,260
That's true, but I didn't ask you to
unseat their favorite prophet.

106
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,580
Yeah, and now a town ripe for uprising is
under the rule of the military again.

107
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,620
Wait a minute.

108
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,320
Is that what you were planning all along?

109
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,180
You know, I've heard an odd rumor about
Xenotime and its land baron, Mugear.

110
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,680
Apparently, he's missing and his mansion
collapsed.

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,180
Yeah, Xenotime.

112
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:23,260
Now where is that again?

113
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,300
That's a city, right?

114
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:27,240
Maybe I should have you file a report on
the Red Water, too.

115
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,940
I almost forgot.

116
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,680
We had a little inquiry from a detective
in Aquroya.

117
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,260
So tell me.

118
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,880
Is it true Psiren's a real ten under the
mask?

119
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,679
So you know everything I do.

120
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:45,073
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

121
00:06:45,098 --> 00:06:45,467
Great.

122
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:46,572
I'm glad we had this talk.

123
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,680
Settle down, Edward.

124
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,860
You could at least look like you're
following orders.

125
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,620
Why?

126
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
So I can turn into another one of your
toadies?

127
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,900
We've got other objectives, you know.

128
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,960
Like the Philosopher's Stone.

129
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,380
It's been three years and you haven't
gotten any closer.

130
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,440
I'm going to find it, no matter what.

131
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,437
Colonel

132
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,640
Tell me if the name Marco rings
any bells for you.

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,698
He's a doctor and
alchemist who showed up in

134
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:27,021
Xenotime with no
background five years ago.

135
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,357
Apparently, he cured the
poisoning caused by the Red Water,

136
00:07:30,358 --> 00:07:33,360
which no one else could do,
using some kind of alchemy.

137
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,208
You always seem to know a
little about everything, and the

138
00:07:36,209 --> 00:07:38,580
military's bound to have a
file on someone that skilled.

139
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,560
The name isn't familiar, no.

140
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,260
But I'll check on it.

141
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,440
Company, sir.

142
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,460
What brings me this pleasant surprise,
Brigadier General?

143
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:07,118
As of today, we'll be taking over this
East HQ as our temporary central command.

144
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,100
May I ask what's wrong with the one in
Central, sir?

145
00:08:10,579 --> 00:08:11,855
HA HA HA HA HA HA

146
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,100
I know, Mustang.

147
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,640
I asked the same thing.

148
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,180
Sorry for the hassle.

149
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,540
Everybody at ease now.

150
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,320
Fuhrer Bradley, welcome, sir.

151
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,240
Your job is not to ask questions,
Colonel.

152
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,740
The Fuhrer and his staff
will run this place, both to

153
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:28,200
operate as Central Command
and to observe the region.

154
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,080
I trust you'll make us comfortable.

155
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,700
Look at all those chains.

156
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,820
Those are for the Silver Pocket Watches.

157
00:08:37,821 --> 00:08:39,862
They only give out to state alchemists,
aren't they?

158
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,360
Yeah.

159
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,900
Means every one of these guys is a full
-fledged alchemist.

160
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,330
Look, can you believe how big Alicia's
gotten?

161
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:50,970
She can even ride a tricycle now.

162
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,370
She follows me everywhere on that thing,
like my own escort of cuteness.

163
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,730
Yep, you're the same as ever, Major.

164
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,810
Nice and insane.

165
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,450
I've got more pictures.

166
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,050
Wanna see?

167
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,030
Maybe later, okay?

168
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,010
Anyway, if you knew this transfer was gonna
happen, you could have warned Mustang.

169
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:07,190
Not a chance!

170
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,850
I had to see the look on Roy's face.

171
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,070
Oh, by the way, I'm a Lieutenant Colonel
now.

172
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:14,610
Got me in charge of court martial
investigations.

173
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,790
Sounds fun-filled beyond belief.

174
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,450
Shouldn't you be in Central, then?

175
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,170
Why?

176
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,990
So I can work in a bunch of empty offices?

177
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:25,390
All the major bigwigs are fleeing
Central as fast as they... Never mind.

178
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,050
How's the search going for the,
uh... you know what stone?

179
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,390
Well, we're closer to where I'd like to
think we are.

180
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,890
Right now I'm looking for a guy named
Marco who might have answers for me.

181
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:38,470
But I can't get Mustang to tell me what
he's got on him.

182
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,871
Well, have you considered that he might
not have anything?

183
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:42,010
No.

184
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:43,770
Roy Mustang's hiding stuff from me.

185
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,830
I can definitely tell.

186
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:50,130
Did I hear you say the name Marco
Fullmetal?

187
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,130
Brigadier General Grand.

188
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,950
The Iron Blood Alchemist.

189
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:55,150
What do you want?

190
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,070
What do you want with Marco?

191
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,010
He's a filthy deserter.

192
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:03,951
Six years ago, a brigade
of State Alchemists

193
00:10:03,952 --> 00:10:05,870
were called on to
neutralize the Eastern

194
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,270
Rebellion and Marco was in
their ranks.

195
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,170
But he went AWOL before the battle was
done.

196
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,510
The coward's been missing ever since.

197
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,510
A deserter?

198
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:19,190
Don't know him.

199
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,470
Sorry.

200
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,450
Dr. Marcoh?

201
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:21,070
Nope.

202
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,330
Dr. Marcoh?

203
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:22,970
Not here.

204
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:23,930
Damn it.

205
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,130
Wouldn't you know it?

206
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,811
He's been erased from all the record
books.

207
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,250
Clearly Mustang knows, but he's not
talking.

208
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,890
I'll have to beat it out of him.

209
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:31,450
A fight?

210
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,770
You can get away with that.

211
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:33,096
Meow

212
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:36,890
Is your stomach purring?

213
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:37,410
Yes.

214
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,150
I mean, no.

215
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,830
I mean, you know it's still raining
outside.

216
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,230
Ed, I forgot to mention something earlier.

217
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,090
What with the pictures...
Get to the point!

218
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:45,670
Fine.

219
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:46,530
I will.

220
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,770
Rude little...

221
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:51,450
As I was saying, due to conditions,
your assessments will be held here,

222
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:51,950
Ed.

223
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,816
Assessments?

224
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:55,736
You mean to renew a State Alchemy
certification?

225
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,290
I'll tell you later about all your
options.

226
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,470
I've got it, Major!

227
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:01,990
Lieutenant Colonel!

228
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,830
Seriously, I know the perfect way to show
off my skills.

229
00:11:06,596 --> 00:11:07,036
Right?

230
00:11:07,431 --> 00:11:08,431
Oh, no.

231
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,840
Battle assessment?

232
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:18,960
Sounds weird.

233
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,720
Does the Army really do that?

234
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,780
Yeah, sometimes.

235
00:11:21,805 --> 00:11:23,744
The alchemists go up
against each other in a mock

236
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:26,041
battle, and they're graded
on how they use their skills.

237
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,040
I just think it's weird Ed actually
requested it.

238
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,880
Yeah, and picking the Colonel.

239
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,160
That's a heck of an opponent to take by
choice.

240
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,920
Seriously, though.

241
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,860
Who do you think would win, if they were
both really giving their all?

242
00:11:37,861 --> 00:11:38,535
Are you kidding?

243
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,560
It's gotta be the Flame!

244
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,420
I don't know.

245
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,040
You can't count out FullMetal,
either.

246
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,820
The Kid's a hero in this region.

247
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,620
Then again, when you think about all the
stories of Mustang during the Rebellion...

248
00:11:47,621 --> 00:11:49,500
But why would Ed propose this to begin
with?

249
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,300
It's so risky.

250
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,760
I heard it was for a cat.

251
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,980
The conditions are that if Ed wins,
Mustang has to take care of it.

252
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,140
A cat?

253
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,180
I guess that's bad news for this guy.

254
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,940
I was hoping the Colonel would take him.

255
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Sir?

256
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,160
Dog, huh?

257
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,900
I love dogs!

258
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,160
Really?

259
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,040
You mean it?

260
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,180
Of course!

261
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,100
Dogs embody loyalty.

262
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,820
They follow their master's commands above
all else.

263
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:25,740
Be a jerk to them and they don't complain,
and they never once beg for a paycheck.

264
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,060
Trust me, Fury, they're the great servants
of man!

265
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,320
Loyal canine Howie, salute thee!

266
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,260
Well, you're awfully manic today,
sir.

267
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,160
I figured that challenge would worry you
some.

268
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,600
Come on, the Fuhrer knows it wouldn't be
fair with me against the kid.

269
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,300
I'd love to show off my valor,
but there's no way he's going to allow it.

270
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,360
That sounds like a very interesting fight.

271
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,340
I'm going to allow the battle assessment.

272
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,660
But, Fuhrer... Fuhrer's
spoken, Colonel.

273
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,060
You can use the parade grounds.

274
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,880
That way you won't have to worry about all
the collateral damage.

275
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
What's wrong, Mustang?

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,440
You're sure of your own skills,
aren't you?

277
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,040
Go on.

278
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,120
Fight Fullmetal.

279
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,980
I think it's going to be a lot of fun.

280
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,460
You can't say I didn't try to protect the
kid.

281
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:14,768
But I'll dutifully obey
my orders, at least until I

282
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:16,960
become Fuhrer and every
one of them is obeying me.

283
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,600
Be more discreet about those declarations,
sir.

284
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,840
Some would call them treason.

285
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,060
She's right, Chief.

286
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,440
It's a presumptuous thing to say.

287
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
You got a death wish or something?

288
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,480
That's a stupid question, Havok.

289
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,000
I say it because it's true.

290
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,060
And when I'm Fuhrer, there will be
changes.

291
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,340
That day... All female officers will
be required to wear tiny miniskirts!

292
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
You're a miracle, Mustang.

293
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:45,260
I'll follow you for the rest of my life.

294
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Yes.

295
00:13:52,619 --> 00:13:54,281
Ladies and Gentlemen!

296
00:13:54,306 --> 00:13:57,035
Welcome To the Easter
Command Center Festival!

297
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,900
A guaranteed break from that soldier
grind.

298
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,680
Incidentally, take a look.

299
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,800
My daughter, who turned three this year!

300
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Isn't she adorable?

301
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,415
Oh, no!

302
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Don't fall on Daddy!

303
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
Elicia!

304
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,387
Ow.

305
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:23,030
And now without further distraction,
we move directly to the day's main event.

306
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:27,290
In the red corner, the flame alchemist and
hero of the Eastern Rebellion...

307
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,910
Colonel Roy Mustang!

308
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,050
Give it up!

309
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,810
You just won a promotion.

310
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,090
Give me back, my girlfriend!

311
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:38,268
In the blue corner, the full metal
alchemist and living legend of the people.

312
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,490
Let's hear it for Edward Elric!

313
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:41,263
What?

314
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:41,730
Where?

315
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:42,930
I can't see him.

316
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,370
Walking gravestone is more like it.

317
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,450
Good luck, beansprout.

318
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,970
Don't call me small!

319
00:14:48,056 --> 00:14:50,246
I'll break down your feet
and stick them on your head!

320
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,190
Okay, Al, you're right.

321
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,430
Today's a great day.

322
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,637
The day I beat Mustang's
pompous mug in front

323
00:14:55,638 --> 00:14:57,710
of the whole army and
get some damn respect.

324
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,111
But we're indebted to him, brother.

325
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:00,010
He's asked for it.

326
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,590
Saying he knows all we do.

327
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:03,170
Acting like he let our secret out.

328
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,130
Then not telling me what I need to know.

329
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:06,750
So what's your strategy?

330
00:15:07,630 --> 00:15:09,790
I told you, a fist in his face!

331
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,860
This assessment means nothing to me.

332
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:19,300
If I win, you tell me all you know about
Marcoh.

333
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,700
And let's not forget you'll have a new
cat.

334
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,800
Alchemist, get set...

335
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,418
Ready to fight!

336
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,240
What?

337
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Too slow.

338
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,200
Damn it!

339
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,220
That was a cheap shot!

340
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,300
A soldier favors haste over cleverness.

341
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,420
Means there are no cheap shots,
Edward.

342
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,660
Strike quickly and you'll end it quickly,
too.

343
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,880
Those flames are coming out of nowhere.

344
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,080
How does he do that?

345
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,160
Oh, this is the first time you've seen the
Colonel fight?

346
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,640
His right glove's made of special material
called ignition cloth.

347
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,660
When he snaps, it makes a spark.

348
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,420
After that, he uses alchemy to change the
oxygen density in the air.

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,260
And, boom, bombs on command.

350
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,140
Just relax!

351
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,300
Stop running!

352
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Sorry!

353
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,740
Well, I guess I can't torch you all.

354
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,020
This is hard.

355
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,480
He's such a small target.

356
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,800
Who are you calling small?

357
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,723
If your opponent is of
choleric temper, seek to

358
00:16:28,724 --> 00:16:31,421
irritate and never fall
for an enemy's taunts.

359
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,460
You've gotta be kidding me!

360
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,560
Okay, maybe I overdid it.

361
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,560
Need more?

362
00:16:48,601 --> 00:16:49,361
Damn.

363
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,030
Without that glove, you can't
make flames anymore, can you?

364
00:16:54,790 --> 00:16:55,810
Advantage, Elric!

365
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,085
All war is deception.

366
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,830
Think your enemy has a weakness and it
becomes his strength.

367
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,990
Remember that.

368
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:29,830
Just end it.

369
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,930
You don't have to ask.

370
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,610
All right, that's far enough.

371
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,650
An excellent fight by two skilled
alchemists.

372
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,490
We are honored by your compliment,
Fuhrer.

373
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,410
Don't stop us now!

374
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,490
We're not done yet!

375
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,050
Hmph.

376
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:56,310
That may be true, but if
I let you go on, it would

377
00:17:56,311 --> 00:17:59,231
be much harder for just
the two of you to clean up.

378
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,140
They don't have a choice but to spend time
together now.

379
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,600
The Fuhrer ordered them both to fix the
mess.

380
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,460
This is the reason I tried to avoid the
fight, Ed.

381
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
What happened?

382
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,400
Why did you hesitate at the end?

383
00:18:22,779 --> 00:18:23,352
Huh?

384
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,380
I don't need anyone to cover for me.

385
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,760
If you had time to beat me, you should
have done it.

386
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,699
This goes back more years
than I care to admit, but

387
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,081
there was something
called the Ishbal Rebellion.

388
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,040
Part of the Eastern Rebellion,
right?

389
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,440
When the people of Ishbal  clashed with the
military.

390
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:48,400
I saw my share... of really terrible
things.

391
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:19,855
Dr. Marcoh, the deserter.

392
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,800
He was the smartest one among us.

393
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,800
I still think so, even now.

394
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Is that why you kept quiet about him?

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Out of respect?

396
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,480
But maybe I was wrong not to tell you.

397
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,980
You should pay him a visit, so you'll know
for yourself.

398
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,360
You mean he's alive?

399
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,690
You still haven't told me yet.

400
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,810
Why you hesitated and didn't finish me
when you could.

401
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:47,530
Never mind.

402
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:48,930
You don't have to say.

403
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:57,040
Well, if you've got no other candidates,
I guess I can handle him, Kane.

404
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,700
Really?

405
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,840
That's awesome!

406
00:20:05,136 --> 00:20:05,995
Sorry,

407
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,700
guess he's just relieved to have an owner.

408
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:20,170
Now you won't be doing that again,
will you, Pup?

409
00:20:20,171 --> 00:20:22,510
See, you've got a strict mommy now.

410
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,130
The bathroom's out here.

411
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,430
Got it, Black Hayate?

412
00:20:25,956 --> 00:20:28,039
What's wrong with all you people?

413
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:32,430
About Lior, that desert town in Ed's
report.

414
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:36,810
Are you aware that General Hakuro's
detachment has been dispatched over there?

415
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:40,450
I hear it's turning into a pretty ugly
civil war.

416
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,072
Ed said their prophet,
Cornelo, had been removed

417
00:20:44,073 --> 00:20:46,431
as a sham, and the people
would open their eyes.

418
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,130
But a priest is still there and going
strong.

419
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,770
And now he's calling his followers to this
uprising.

420
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:55,350
I can't say for sure if it's the same guy
who Ed fought, though.

421
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:58,910
You think you should send Ed in to
investigate?

422
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,390
Ed believes he saved that town.

423
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,170
It's one of the first successes he's had.

424
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,330
I'll let him keep thinking that for a
while.

425
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,410
He'll learn the truth soon enough.

426
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,110
We always do.

427
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,984
After all the info the
Colonel gave us on Marco,

428
00:21:14,985 --> 00:21:17,591
we can't ask him to
keep this little guy, too.

429
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,190
Equivalent exchange, we'd end up owing too
much.

430
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:21,950
Yeah, I know.

431
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm sorry, Al.

432
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,320
It's just the best we can do.

433
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:41,230
So, isn't it about time you told me?

434
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,170
I know you didn't all come here to observe
us.

435
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,410
The bigwigs.

436
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:49,490
They kept wearing the Fuhrer down until he
agreed to move us.

437
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:51,990
It's the alchemist killer, Roy.

438
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:55,670
There have already been five officer
slayings in Central.

439
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,770
You wont win!

440
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,790
They'll find you!

441
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,030
You're a barbarian!

442
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,050
Nothing more!

443
00:22:19,967 --> 00:22:21,140
Time to head east.

444
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,600
Full Metal Alchemist Episode 14,
Destruction's Right Hand.

445
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,680
I don't care about your cause, even if
it's vengeance on all state alchemists.

446
00:23:47,681 --> 00:23:49,626
I won't let you kill my brother.
