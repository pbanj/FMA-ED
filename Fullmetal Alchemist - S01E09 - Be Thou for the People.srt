1
00:00:02,687 --> 00:00:04,933
Come on. EEEEEE!

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:09,580
I'll take the chrome steel spanner set,
this hydraulic torque wrench, and can I

3
00:00:09,581 --> 00:00:10,989
take a look at that micrometer,
please?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:11,280
Sure!

5
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:15,100
Oh, and please throw in whichever ultra
-hardtip drill bit you think is the best!

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:15,900
You got it!

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:18,060
It's everything that I dreamed it would
be.

8
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,680
Central sure puts her small-town selection
to shame.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,420
And I just can't get over how good the walnut
handle on the screwdriver feels on my skin!

10
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:27,040
Are you almost done in there, Woodry?

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't you think you have enough souvenirs
for one trip?

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:30,960
What?

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,800
But you told me you'd buy me anything I
wanted today!

14
00:00:33,801 --> 00:00:35,160
Isn't that right, Ed?

15
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,427
Yeah.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,480
I love these high-carbon chrome steel
cutting shears!

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,160
They'll cut through anything and never
rust!

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,400
Can I have these, too?

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,060
Sure.

20
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,740
Sir, could you add this sewing machine oil
to my tab?

21
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:51,560
Of course!

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:53,140
Here.

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
This is for you.

24
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,640
Without me around, you'll have to take
care of your own auto-mail.

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,540
Mr. Elric.

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,640
Mustang wants to see you.

27
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,020
There's a mission for me?

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,340
Yeah.

29
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:15,400
Now that you're a real estate alchemist, you
have to be ready to leave at a moment's notice.

30
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,380
It's our life.

31
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,120
Second Lieutenant Hawkeye?

32
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:18,640
Yes, sir.

33
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,800
Here are your orders and case file.

34
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,240
Full Metal Alchemist Edward Elric.

35
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,800
You are hereby ordered to inspect the coal
mine at Youswell.

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,880
Is this kind of thing really a job for a
state alchemist?

37
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,180
It entails inspecting the mine resources.

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,140
As an alchemist, you do have knowledge of
minerals, don't you?

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,760
As it's your first mission, I've decided
to keep the training wheels on.

40
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,900
But that won't mean that you can take it
easy.

41
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

42
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,460
To obtain, something of equal value must
be lost.

43
00:02:00,461 --> 00:02:03,880
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

44
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:11,420
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

45
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,180
It feels like we've got our own private
car, huh?

46
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,240
I like traveling by train.

47
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,120
You can just sit and watch the world go by
outside.

48
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,383
Al?

49
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:08,840
Hm?

50
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,000
I have to do this now that the state has
me on a leash.

51
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,020
But there's no reason you should suffer,
too.

52
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:14,920
We're brothers.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,640
If we don't help each other, no one will.

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,880
You're line's, remember?

55
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,940
So, when can we expect to see you back
home?

56
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,580
We're not going back.

57
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:26,260
Ed...

58
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:30,240
Winry, there's no home left for us to
return to.

59
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,460
You're right.

60
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:37,860
Huh?

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:38,720
Look!

62
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,980
I think I can see it!

63
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,500
So that's the last town to the east.

64
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,480
Youswell.

65
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:52,510
It's supposed to be a coal mining town,
but it looks more like a ghost town to me.

66
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,750
Everyone here looks so worn down.

67
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,230
It doesn't look like there's going to be
much to do here.

68
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:02,770
Let's hurry and finish so we can blow this
ho-Hm?

69
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:03,790
Sorry.

70
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:06,590
Wait, are you guys tourists?

71
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,650
Where are you from?

72
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:08,670
Have you eaten?

73
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,645
Where are you staying?

74
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,510
Hell of a welcoming committee.

75
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:11,970
Pop!

76
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:12,710
We got visitors!

77
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,390
What are you going on about?

78
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:15,350
Over here!

79
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,550
Big Spenders!

80
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:18,110
Big Spenders?

81
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,710
Hey, my name is Holling.

82
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:20,850
I run the local inn.

83
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,230
We'll take good care of you.

84
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,510
So, what do you think?

85
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,010
I know it's not much, but since the coal
mine's wages are so low, at least with

86
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:30,730
this place, I can keep two irons in the
fire.

87
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,750
Now that'll be a room for two for one
night.

88
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,750
And what are your rates?

89
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:36,490
Well, they ain't cheap.

90
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,610
I'm sure we can cope.

91
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,010
Despite our appearances, we've got plenty
of cash.

92
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,710
$200,000.

93
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:42,250
What?

94
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,930
$200,000?

95
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:44,598
That's ridiculous!

96
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:46,690
You gotta put gold bars on our pillows?

97
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,370
It's a fair price, seeing how ours is the
finest inn in all of Youswell.

98
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,250
Not to mention it's the only one.

99
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:56,833
We ain't had any guests in some time, so
we've got to milk you folks for all you're worth.

100
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,970
It's not even close to enough.

101
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,450
We spent all that money on Winry.

102
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,650
Guess we go to Plan B.

103
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:11,216
Wow!

104
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,450
He fixed it!

105
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:14,010
It looks as good as new!

106
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,070
Come on!

107
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,210
What else needs fixing?

108
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,970
Well, if it's not too much trouble.

109
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:21,430
This is special to me, but it's broken.

110
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:24,050
You still haven't thrown out that old
piece of junk?

111
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,930
Maybe if you bought us some nice things
once in a while.

112
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,070
Here, I'll take care of that.

113
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,930
Thank you... so much.

114
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,910
Hey, that looks pretty nice!

115
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,830
Who'd have thought that our first tourist
in ages would be a real-life alchemist?

116
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,290
I took a crack at alchemy myself once,
but never went anywhere with it.

117
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:45,869
Hey!

118
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:47,710
So, what brings you to Youswelll?

119
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:49,830
There's not much here for someone like
you.

120
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,010
It's business.

121
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:53,450
In fact, I've come here to inspect the
coal mine.

122
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,468
Inspect?

123
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,190
Then you're a part of the military?

124
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,410
Well, yeah.

125
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,370
I'm a state alchemist.

126
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:02,930
Cool, huh?

127
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:03,650
Hey!

128
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,210
What was that for?

129
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:11,230
We have no food or beds to offer any dogs
of the military.

130
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,115
You one of them, too?

131
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,030
Well, no, not... He's
got nothing to do with it!

132
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,530
I just met him on the train, on the way
here!

133
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:21,890
Fine, then.

134
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,790
You can sleep on the street like the rest
of the dogs.

135
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,470
Your dad sure feels strongly about it.

136
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:32,270
Of course he does.

137
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,310
Everyone around here hates the stupid
army.

138
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:38,530
And that greedy sucker Yoki who's in
charge of this place is the worst of all of them.

139
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,310
Yoki?

140
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:44,570
And now he's got that sneaky little state
alchemist to do all his dirty work.

141
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,530
Alchemist, be thou for the people.

142
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:48,070
That's their crock of a slogan.

143
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:51,110
But the only people they care about are
their own damned selves.

144
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:56,770
But, sir... There's self-righteous
thugs who sell their soul to the state.

145
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:00,210
Moon, old pal, I'm so hungry.

146
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,639
I wish you were cheese.

147
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,480
Ah, winry.

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,360
If only you'd think about my human parts
instead of my metal ones now and then.

149
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,760
She does think about your human side.

150
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,340
I snuck this out for you.

151
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,532
Al.

152
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,860
After all, I can't eat it.

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,500
They really do hate the military here.

154
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,020
Yeah, I'll watch that from now on.

155
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,560
Maybe I should enlist, too.

156
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,240
And become a state alchemist alongside
you.

157
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,080
Are you nuts?

158
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,480
It's bad enough that one of us has to play
their silly games.

159
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:40,920
Having another lightning rod won't make
this any easier, Al.

160
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,300
But, brother... Step aside!

161
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:47,580
Your inn is as charmingly filthy as ever,
Harling.

162
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,180
Lieutenant Yoki, you know you should cover
up your face more often.

163
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,300
It's a good look for you.

164
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Enough small talk.

165
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:57,620
The taxes on this place are long past due,
and it's not just you, Harling.

166
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,200
I could say the same for the whole town.

167
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,920
Our wages are too low to afford tax,
sir.

168
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,080
You're paid so little because that's what
you men are worth.

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,386
What?

170
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:10,520
You know you can't just lower our wages
and then turn around and raise our taxes

171
00:09:10,521 --> 00:09:14,980
and expect us to... The state has given Lieutenant
Yoki unilateral authority over this mine.

172
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:15,880
Shut up!

173
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,600
He only got to where he is by taking the
money we sweat and bled for and using it

174
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,740
to bribe the higher-ups!

175
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,760
Hmph.

176
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:25,380
If you've got all this figured out,
then perhaps you should try bribing me.

177
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,360
But don't blame me, because you have to
grease the wheels.

178
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:29,660
It's the way of the world.

179
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,620
Yeah, and sometimes the way of the world
is the little man gets beat!

180
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,530
Nicely done, Lira.

181
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,030
It seems the rumors of this establishment
becoming a hangout for rebels,

182
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:55,630
toughs, and thugs are true.

183
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,870
I may have no choice but to suspend your
operating license.

184
00:09:59,170 --> 00:09:59,410
What?

185
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,770
No, you can't!

186
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,490
You brat!

187
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:06,230
Oh, Kyle!

188
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,370
Don't kill him.

189
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,890
We just want him to be an example.

190
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,670
Please, no!

191
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,040
Who the hell are you?

192
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,500
When I heard the lieutenant would be
dropping in, I thought I'd come by and say hello.

193
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,320
Is that what I... Who does
this kid think he is, sir?

194
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,300
You moron!

195
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:36,200
That watch makes him a state alchemist,
which means he reports directly to King Bradley!

196
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,700
How terribly rude of my subordinate.

197
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,000
Please forgive his idiocy.

198
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:43,480
I'm Lieutenant Yoki, the man in charge
here.

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,480
So, what business might you have in our
humble little burg?

200
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,540
I'm just here to conduct an inspection.

201
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:50,720
An inspection?

202
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,600
Marvelous!

203
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,560
But you must come stay at my mansion.

204
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:58,700
I hope you haven't had to mingle with
these unwashed masses for too long.

205
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:02,920
Loathsome dogs.

206
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,700
Congratulations, Mustang.

207
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,600
I hear you're being promoted to a full
colonel soon.

208
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,740
And Hawkeye, you'll be bumped up to first
lieutenant.

209
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,860
Thank you, General Hikuro, sir.

210
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:22,720
Once the promotions go through, I'd like you to
supervise the Eastern Command Center for a while.

211
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:23,878
I think you'd do well there.

212
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,160
You're demoting me already?

213
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,990
I can see how having someone like me around
Central would... What are you talking about?

214
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,960
This isn't a demotion.

215
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,840
It's a transfer, Colonel Mustang.

216
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,660
But watch your back there, because I hear
our people in the Eastern Division...

217
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,200
are less than upstanding.

218
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,220
It's such a great honor for me to be
hosting a genuine state alchemist
such as yourself in my home.

219
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,840
And since we are so blessed as to have
such a talented scientist in our midst,

220
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:51,080
you should have him take a look at your
alchemic attempts, Lyra.

221
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,580
Yes.

222
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,520
Nah, I already saw.

223
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:59,080
She liquefied the air around her,
reduced its volume, and then
vaporized it, producing a shockwave.

224
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:04,520
The light came from the heat generated by the
forced compression, needed to maintain entropy.

225
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,560
You could deduce all that by just looking
at it?

226
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,900
Actually, my ultimate goal is to become a
state alchemist.

227
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,020
To be just like you, Mr. Elric.

228
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,040
To be like me?

229
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:14,920
Yes.

230
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:19,100
I wish nothing more than to do all that I
can do for the state.

231
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,140
And now, bon appetit.

232
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,860
You'll need strength for the work ahead.

233
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,720
I do hope that our provincial cuisine
suits your refined tastes.

234
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,560
You eat pretty well, considering the
economic conditions of this town.

235
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,000
Times are tough for all of us.

236
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:37,060
I tell you, I've had plenty of trouble
collecting taxes.

237
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,740
And those miners can be so brutishly
obstinate sometimes as you saw.

238
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,720
And by obstinate, you mean asserting their rights
and refusing to pay you more than they earn.

239
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,220
See?

240
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,220
You get it.

241
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,540
I knew you were a man of great
understanding.

242
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:54,040
To understand the world, we have only to
follow one basic principle.

243
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,320
Equivalent exchange.

244
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,020
The founding law of alchemy.

245
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,200
You can't get without giving.

246
00:12:59,400 --> 00:12:59,960
Right?

247
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:00,960
Absolutely.

248
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,440
Eloquently put.

249
00:13:02,441 --> 00:13:06,340
I myself have long conducted business
under a similar guiding principle,

250
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,900
in the spirit of which...

251
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,040
Lira?

252
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,300
Please accept this small token of my
appreciation.

253
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,340
This supposed to be some kind of a bribe,
Yoki?

254
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,140
That is such an ugly word.

255
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,620
Why don't we just call it equivalent
exchange?

256
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,640
Now then, there is the matter of your
inspection.

257
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,740
Yeah, I get your drift.

258
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,600
I knew you would.

259
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,320
You are truly a man of great
understanding.

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,740
Oh, and I have a feeling the townspeople
will start behaving themselves very shortly.

261
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,360
I hope Ed is doing all right on his own.

262
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,650
Hey, what's going on?

263
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:01,310
Kyle Kyle!

264
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,830
My God. My son's still in there!

265
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,750
You can't, boss!

266
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:04,950
It's too dangerous now!

267
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:05,830
We'll lose you both!

268
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:06,770
I don't care!

269
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:07,530
Let me go!

270
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,019
Kyle!

271
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:14,970
Kyle!

272
00:14:15,703 --> 00:14:16,343
Kyle!

273
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,450
Come on, Kyle.

274
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,350
Where are you?

275
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,750
Kyle!

276
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,510
Kyle!

277
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:21,861
Dad!

278
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:28,250
I'm here.

279
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,150
Is this Yoki's doing?

280
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:42,470
Mm-hmm.

281
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,570
You're some kind of super alchemist,
right?

282
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,830
So, can't you just make some gold?

283
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,010
For my dad?

284
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:53,010
You could save the whole town.

285
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,210
I can't.

286
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:55,930
Why not?

287
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,190
It won't cost you nothing.

288
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,310
You're wrong.

289
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,110
The whole world is equivalent exchange.

290
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,790
I give you gold, and I'd have to pay the
price.

291
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,490
And I've got no reason to do that.

292
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,670
So we have to bribe you now, too?

293
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,550
And you call yourself an alchemist?

294
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,770
Alchemist be thou for the people.

295
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,950
What a load that is.

296
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,290
Transmuting gold's a serious offense.

297
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,110
If I'm caught, they'll not only strip me
of my state alchemist certification,

298
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:24,970
but they'll throw me in jail.

299
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,567
Then do it so you don't get caught!

300
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,510
Even if I could.

301
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,410
It'd just get taken away in taxes.

302
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:35,490
If it's that awful here, why don't you all just
saddle up and move on to another village?

303
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:36,390
Kid.

304
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:36,850
Huh?

305
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,390
This may not make a lot of sense to you.

306
00:15:39,391 --> 00:15:40,530
But this place?

307
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,090
Well, it's both our home and our coffin.

308
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,940
Home and coffin.

309
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,200
That's got a nice ring.

310
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,400
What are you doing?

311
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,600
Al, we burned our home to the ground on
purpose.

312
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,360
We've got nowhere to go back to,
and that's fine.

313
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,820
Because we chose it.

314
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,420
But... I don't know.

315
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,760
Maybe equivalent exchange goes further
than we thought.

316
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:13,080
Al, what you're about to see stays just
between us.

317
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:26,750
You want to buy the Youswelll coal mine?

318
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,930
That's right, and while you're here I'd
like you to throw in everything from the

319
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:31,250
trade route to the town itself.

320
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:31,910
Okay?

321
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:36,830
Well, I'm afraid even for a state alchemist
like yourself, the mine just isn't for sale.

322
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,750
Oh, that's too bad.

323
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,530
In here we lugged all this in for nothing.

324
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:44,650
Huh?!

325
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,210
Is... Is that...?

326
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:47,930
Real gold?

327
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:52,290
Turns out the mine's full of unexploited
minerals that'd be a real booster shot for

328
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,110
alchemic research.

329
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:56,770
And I'd hate to miss out, but if it's not
on the market...

330
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:58,390
Don't be absurd.

331
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:02,170
Although, the mine was entrusted to me by
my state to govern.

332
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:06,690
Selling it for my own personal profit might
appear to some observers too, uh... Right.

333
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:09,430
Don't worry, none of this gold appears on
any of the books.

334
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:12,970
So as long as we both keep our mouths
shut, no one has to know anything about it.

335
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,970
But still... Hmm... I've got it.

336
00:17:15,971 --> 00:17:19,630
What if you write up an official deed
stating you hand over all rights to the

337
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:21,210
mine to me, free of charge?

338
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:25,010
Then you can take all of this as an
unrelated gift.

339
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:26,310
Lieutenant.

340
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,010
Why?

341
00:17:31,011 --> 00:17:32,290
Why can't I fight?

342
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,910
Because I can't risk losing you again,
son.

343
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,030
But they smashed our inn.

344
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:37,490
We have to make them pay for that.

345
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:38,491
It's just a building, Kyle.

346
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,910
Nothing that's worth dying for.

347
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:41,410
Hi!

348
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:44,930
So, let's see if I can't turn those frowns
upside down.

349
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:45,850
You leech!

350
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,810
What do you want now?

351
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:47,810
Come on!

352
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:51,550
Is that any way to talk to your new boss,
landlord, and all-around overseer?

353
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:52,430
Overseer?

354
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:58,670
What the hell are... As you can see, I hold in
my hand the title deed to the mine, trade routes,

355
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,390
and the entire town of Youswelll.

356
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:00,750
What?

357
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:04,810
In other words, pretty much everything
around here belongs to me now.

358
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,418
You follow?

359
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,330
However, I have to be getting back to my
busy life in Central.

360
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:13,890
I'm not even sure this is worth carrying
to the city with me.

361
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,830
It's so...

362
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,264
So heavy.

363
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:18,850
So, you're going to try and sell it back
to us for a profit?

364
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,710
You bet.

365
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,330
And it ain't going to be cheap,
to use your phrase.

366
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,530
You remember equivalent exchange,
don't you?

367
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,050
Hmm.

368
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,890
After all, not only is this deed written
on high-grade parchment, it's got gold

369
00:18:29,891 --> 00:18:31,030
leaf trim on the edges.

370
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:36,490
It comes in a box decorated with finely
crushed Jade in a nonchalant, yet at the

371
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:38,090
same time luxurious, design.

372
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Oh, yeah, this is craftsmanship.

373
00:18:40,150 --> 00:18:41,850
And the key's sterling silver.

374
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:45,410
See, I'd say it's got to be worth a round,
too, if it's worth $200,000.

375
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:46,690
$200,000?

376
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,110
For the deed to use?

377
00:18:48,190 --> 00:18:49,170
Well, that's all.

378
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,250
Really?

379
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:54,650
You know, now that I think about it,
a room at the inn costs $200,000.

380
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,130
I'll spend the night and let's call it
even.

381
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:57,910
Huh.

382
00:18:58,930 --> 00:18:59,671
Equivalent exchange.

383
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:02,230
But our inn was destroyed last night.

384
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,090
Hmm.

385
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:03,950
Really?

386
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:05,890
Then what's that over there?

387
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,030
It's new again.

388
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,590
Like magic, but real.

389
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,390
So this should cover my stay here,
right?

390
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:17,750
Huh.

391
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,330
Yes, of course, Ed.

392
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:19,830
Good.

393
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,970
It's an even trade.

394
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:23,870
Elric!

395
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,710
What's the meaning of this?

396
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,650
All of a sudden, the gold bars you gave me
turned to stone!

397
00:19:28,890 --> 00:19:29,370
Gold bars?

398
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,115
I don't know what you're talking about.

399
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,310
Don't toy with me!

400
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,610
I traded you that deed in exchange for a
mountain of gold bars!

401
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,450
No, I'm pretty sure you handed it over to
me free of charge, didn't you?

402
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,430
At least that's what it says in the
letter.

403
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:42,570
Oh.

404
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:43,010
No!

405
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,930
You swindled me, you little...
That's such an ugly word.

406
00:19:46,090 --> 00:19:48,350
Why don't we call it a gift from you to
me?

407
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,090
The transaction's invalid!

408
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:50,810
Lira!

409
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,920
Alchemist, be thou for the people.

410
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:01,900
That's our motto.

411
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,700
If you really want to be like me,
you'll take that to heart.

412
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,720
But you are an alchemist of the state.

413
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,060
How can you defy the military you serve?

414
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,970
Because I never sold my soul to them.

415
00:20:47,241 --> 00:20:48,220
You cursed boy!

416
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,840
Seize the deed from...

417
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,480
Sorry, sir.

418
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:58,300
Now we're gonna do to you physically what
you've been doing to us financially for years!

419
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,780
Never underestimate the strength of a coal
mining man, Lieutenant.

420
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:14,840
You know, honey, I think our inn's even
nicer than before.

421
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:15,720
Uh-huh.

422
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,140
I think so, too.

423
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:22,920
All thanks to Ed Elric, the Fullmetal
Alchemist.

424
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,980
Here's the report from Edward Elric sir.

425
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,940
Great.

426
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,520
Thanks to the incident there, the state
has decided to reorganize the personnel at

427
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:34,840
the Eastern Command Center, who oversaw
the coal mine.

428
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,580
Really?

429
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,020
That should make our jobs a little easier
when we head east.

430
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:42,680
It's almost as though Elric did you and I
a favor by going there.

431
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,020
Don't tell me you planned this from the
start, sir.

432
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,240
Come on.

433
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,880
You think I know everything?

434
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,220
I wonder how pretty the women out east
are.

435
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:54,440
As for Elric, it seems his reputation is
already spreading throughout the region.

436
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,260
They're saying there's a champion of the
people among the military dogs.

437
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,120
Edward Elric?

438
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,620
Yeah, I heard of him.

439
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,720
So, what do you know about the guy?

440
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,460
Well, what they say is that even though
he's one of them state alchemist guys,

441
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,420
he's still a friend of the common man.

442
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,820
Wow, he must be a man of great stature,
then, huh?

443
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,200
Actually, I hear he's surprisingly short,
like a dwarf or something.

444
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:20,000
Who are you calling for?

445
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,940
Stop that, brother.

446
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,660
Get back here.

447
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:24,589
Say that to my face.

448
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,959
Brother, if you keep scaring away cab
drivers, we'll never reach Lior.

449
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:41,540
Full Metal Alchemist Episode 10.

450
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,080
The Phantom Thief.

451
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,080
Isn't it funny, brother?

452
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,880
How sometimes you can look at someone Can
you look at someone and not know whether

453
00:23:48,881 --> 00:23:51,040
they're good or bad?
