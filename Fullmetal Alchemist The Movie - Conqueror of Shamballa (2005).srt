1
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:28,460
This is it my friend the object I spoke
of thanks to our progress with the steam

2
00:00:28,461 --> 00:00:32,740
engine we've excavated deeper than
ever found new minerals and refined them

3
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:37,160
creating revolutionary sources of fuel
and it was in that search for industrial power

4
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:43,227
that we discovered it the ultimate element by splitting
its atom massive amounts of energy are released.

5
00:00:43,874 --> 00:00:47,154
I've chosen to call this all
mighty element Uranium

6
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:51,925
As a respected
ambassidor for the Military

7
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,525
Please help me bring this bomb
to the attention of central command.

8
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,137
No.

9
00:00:57,493 --> 00:01:01,440
You claim it has ultimate potential, but
all you've made is another weapon for war.

10
00:01:01,792 --> 00:01:03,860
That's the last thing
our country needs.

11
00:01:04,293 --> 00:01:04,866
Sorry.

12
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:06,767
But I wont introduce it

13
00:01:07,373 --> 00:01:11,013
Is the young and
promissing Alchemist afraid?

14
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,655
You give such lofty speeches,
but your real reasons are clear.

15
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,820
The state only gives you authority
because of your alchemic power.

16
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:27,780
Authority?

17
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,240
You're scared a weapon like
this will render you obsolete in war.

18
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,869
And without that leverage, the Alchemist's
stranglehold of this state will vanish.

19
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:40,945
Now let's see what the alchemist
of the people really looks like.

20
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,400
hahahaha!

21
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:57,352
Are you so fragile?

22
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,726
A hack in a cheap suit of armor.

23
00:02:08,536 --> 00:02:09,457
Impossible!

24
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:10,635
It's empty!

25
00:02:10,835 --> 00:02:11,665
How can that be?

26
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,557
It couldn't just
move on its own.

27
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:14,582
It's unexplainable!

28
00:02:15,089 --> 00:02:16,609
Everything can be explained.

29
00:02:21,216 --> 00:02:21,776
Huskisson!

30
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:25,510
You made two big mistakes.

31
00:02:25,892 --> 00:02:26,452
What?

32
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,780
Who are you?

33
00:02:27,805 --> 00:02:29,365
Brother, what took you so long?

34
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,470
He put holes in me!

35
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:30,861
Sorry.

36
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:31,730
I got held up.

37
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,063
Tell me who you are!

38
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,290
Mistake number one.

39
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:39,663
You thought we cared
about your invention.

40
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,178
We only came because
you wouldn't shut up about it.

41
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:42,529
What?

42
00:02:43,113 --> 00:02:45,973
That and the off chance that it
could help us on our own search.

43
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:57,513
You'll take me to Central
if you value your life.

44
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,519
And mistake number two.

45
00:03:07,083 --> 00:03:12,810
That young and promising state
alchemist you were looking for is me.

46
00:03:14,206 --> 00:03:15,455
A mechanical arm.

47
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,280
Automail.

48
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,940
So that's what it means.

49
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:22,138
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

50
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:37,750
Damn you!

51
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,331
And your mystical Alchemy.

52
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:46,185
If it wasn't for you zealots, physicists would be
guiding the state into a new and enlightened age.

53
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:47,725
Enlightenment like that?

54
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,670
Uranium mining is dangerous.

55
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:53,090
It's the cost of progress.

56
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:55,690
Science that doesn't benefit
people is no science at all!

57
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,230
Stand back!

58
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,230
You know what this is now.

59
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,190
Interfere and I'll use it!

60
00:05:11,653 --> 00:05:15,296
I may not respect your sorcery, but
that hasn't stopped me from learning it.

61
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,860
For a man first in atomic equations, a
few circles were easy enough to understand.

62
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:23,249
What are you planning now?

63
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,110
It's my backup plan, Fullmetal.

64
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,130
An army of men
fused with machines.

65
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,670
You won't stand a chance.

66
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,010
Don't do it!

67
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,530
That's human transmutation!

68
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,950
Listen to me!

69
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:37,523
Life only flows in one direction and
humans aren't supposed to be brought back.

70
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:40,450
It's Alchemy's greatest
taboo for a reason.

71
00:05:40,451 --> 00:05:42,570
Your arcane rules
mean nothing to me!

72
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:44,090
I'm a man of science!

73
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:45,830
Huskisson!

74
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:47,216
Noooooooo!

75
00:05:52,883 --> 00:05:53,923
What is this?

76
00:06:08,655 --> 00:06:12,335
It's just like what happened to us
when we tried to bring Mom back.

77
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,234
You mean almost like us.

78
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:18,381
You kept my soul here, attaching
it to this armor by trading your arm.

79
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,699
While for his
attempt, he lost it all.

80
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,679
We didn't respect
equivalent exchange.

81
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:25,740
And that's why we need the
stone to get your body back.

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,596
Your arm and leg too, brother.

83
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:28,493
Let's go.

84
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,615
This whole castle's
about to explode.

85
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:30,980
Why?

86
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Because I don't like it.

87
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,220
I made some adjustments
to the steam tanks.

88
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:38,075
Why do you have
to be so excessive?

89
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,160
You should have told me!

90
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,500
There's no point in arguing now.

91
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
Come on, let's go.

92
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,680
Go where?

93
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,540
We're floating on the water and if I
get wet I can wash off my blood seal!

94
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,125
Then stop whining
and help me think!

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,087
We're sinking, we're sinking,
we're sinking, we're sinking!

96
00:06:53,112 --> 00:06:53,432
I know, I know!

97
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,120
I'm trying!

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,100
Faster, Al!

99
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,980
Give me your head!

100
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,180
Hey, brother, stop!

101
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,460
Get that back!

102
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,600
Stop complaining, would you?

103
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,620
I gotta get the water out!

104
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,892
Well, then transmute something!

105
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,240
You don't have to use my head!

106
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,258
Hahahahahahahaha.

107
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,760
So, after that, the story of the champion
of the people, Alchemist, spread from a

108
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,960
few little mining regions to
every corner of the continent.

109
00:07:16,473 --> 00:07:17,533
The end.

110
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,540
You know, you should become
a novelist with the stories you tell.

111
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,360
Saying you don't believe me?

112
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,520
Oh, come on, Ed.

113
00:07:23,521 --> 00:07:26,900
Ed, a place where Alchemy kept evolving
and was more important than the steam engine?

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,600
Hmph.

115
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,160
Newton's laws eclipsed Alchemy,
ushering in the modern age.

116
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,680
That's a historical fact.

117
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,560
Yeah, and this world, you mean.

118
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,540
I'm telling you!

119
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:52,463
Heeeeeeeeeeeeey!

120
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:55,096
Hey, stop!

121
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:57,221
You okay, Alphonse?

122
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,750
It's just a little
cold, that's all.

123
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:07,051
Going to the carnival?

124
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:07,723
We sure are.

125
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,354
Hop in!

126
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:13,605
If you don't mind sitting with gypsies,
we're on our way to the carnival, too.

127
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,835
So, what kind of a show
are you ladies setting up?

128
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,910
You name it.

129
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:28,410
Singing, theater.

130
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,830
What's your act?

131
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:36,550
She's a fortune teller,
and she always gets it right.

132
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,630
So much so, it's eerie.

133
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:42,650
She'll find out all those secrets
you don't want anyone else to know.

134
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,450
So, can you tell me mine?

135
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,170
Cut it out.

136
00:08:46,171 --> 00:08:47,890
You know how
unscientific that is?

137
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,630
You're the same as we are.

138
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,130
You have no home.

139
00:09:02,538 --> 00:09:03,578
There it is!

140
00:09:03,603 --> 00:09:04,463
The carnival!

141
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,702
Ah, Noah!

142
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,880
It's been too long!

143
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,240
I'm paying you in francs.

144
00:12:14,241 --> 00:12:16,840
At this point, blank paper
is worth more than a Mark.

145
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:20,853
What's going on?

146
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:23,093
You're staying here, Noah.

147
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,370
I see now.

148
00:12:28,736 --> 00:12:30,836
You brought me here
just so you could sell me.

149
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:38,223
Able to gaze into a person's
heart just by touching them.

150
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:40,330
Your clairvoyance
is the genuine article.

151
00:12:40,770 --> 00:12:44,710
There are important people who
have use for gifts like that, such as...

152
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,010
Where's Lieutenant Hess?

153
00:12:49,543 --> 00:12:50,403
He's outside.

154
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,550
So this is the girl.

155
00:13:01,222 --> 00:13:02,082
Stop her!

156
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,791
Well, aren't you popular.

157
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,540
Dr. Oberth's book on space flight
has captured the public's imagination.

158
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,260
Thanks for the help.

159
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,300
Done up here, Mr. Heiderich!

160
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,340
Great!

161
00:13:18,886 --> 00:13:20,626
Uh, Ed, where you going?

162
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,560
I'm taking a nap
out by the trucks.

163
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,420
My neck's sore from the crash.

164
00:13:25,947 --> 00:13:26,887
You're not gonna watch?

165
00:13:32,713 --> 00:13:37,033
He was the most enthusiastic of all of
us when we met him at Dr. Oberth's place.

166
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,180
Someone help me!

167
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,210
Aren't you a Gypsy

168
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,175
The men!

169
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,120
They're chasing me!

170
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,325
Yeah, probably because
you stole their wallets.

171
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,130
Everyone knows you
Gypsies are thieves.

172
00:13:50,912 --> 00:13:54,956
As far as I've traveled, I still
can't escape from this place.

173
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:03,486
If I were you, I wouldn't
go digging around in there.

174
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,890
That rocket's set to launch.

175
00:14:08,831 --> 00:14:09,751
There she is!

176
00:14:09,776 --> 00:14:10,176
Hurry!

177
00:14:14,343 --> 00:14:15,583
Nice try, girl.

178
00:14:16,286 --> 00:14:16,675
Hey!

179
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,770
This woman has
a contract with us!

180
00:14:20,196 --> 00:14:20,976
Come on!

181
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:21,943
Help me!

182
00:14:25,122 --> 00:14:26,217
This is a carnival!

183
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,250
Go have some fun!

184
00:14:27,494 --> 00:14:29,384
Hey, I don't think
you heard me right!

185
00:14:29,751 --> 00:14:31,697
We bought this Gypsy
fair and square, boy!

186
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,010
Okay, you asked for it!

187
00:14:39,492 --> 00:14:41,729
Sorry, just an
old habit of mine.

188
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:11,376
You might want to run.

189
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,030
It's a sight to behold.

190
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:29,750
Mr. Hess!

191
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:31,110
Hey, this is the guy.

192
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,670
The one who's offering
to sponsor our research.

193
00:15:35,086 --> 00:15:38,405
You can build what we seek and
lead aeronautics into a new age.

194
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,749
I definitely want
you on our side.

195
00:15:42,396 --> 00:15:42,896
Sure.

196
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,050
Thanks.

197
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:49,150
Lieutenant!

198
00:15:54,099 --> 00:15:55,059
We've got a problem.

199
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,060
The girl escaped.

200
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:56,880
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,320
Escaped how?

202
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:05,950
Where's your home?

203
00:16:07,435 --> 00:16:08,395
I told you.

204
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,270
I don't have one.

205
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:17,882
Preposterous.

206
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,998
I bet you never stepped
foot on the battlefield.

207
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,270
Sure I did.

208
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:24,350
I spent three years in the trenches,
crawling around in the mines.

209
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,670
Then you know it
was breaking us.

210
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,770
And what are we now?

211
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:31,790
The only thing the Treaty of Versailles did was
humiliate us and leave all Germans in poverty.

212
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,750
Except the aristocrats
and the Jews.

213
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:38,103
She escaped.

214
00:16:38,917 --> 00:16:40,077
That is a problem.

215
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,690
I was Wrather hoping she could
find the Great Serpent for us.

216
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:44,836
I'm terribly sorry.

217
00:16:46,503 --> 00:16:47,703
Let's go to the villa.

218
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,810
We need to report
this to Eckhart.

219
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:52,350
Sir!

220
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,813
You sure it's okay?

221
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,280
Me staying here?

222
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,700
They're looking for you.

223
00:17:05,252 --> 00:17:06,232
There's no choice.

224
00:17:08,117 --> 00:17:10,080
Besides, I'm kinda glad.

225
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:10,860
You are?

226
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the first time Ed's really
taken an interest in a girl.

227
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,176
I mean, I'm not trying to say
Ed's some anti-social person.

228
00:17:20,036 --> 00:17:21,436
He just doesn't get
close to anybody.

229
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,800
Not emotionally, anyway.

230
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,300
He's too busy telling stories
about some other world.

231
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,760
You mean his... his home?

232
00:17:29,606 --> 00:17:30,706
That's what he'd say.

233
00:17:31,173 --> 00:17:32,553
Well, gotta run.

234
00:17:32,766 --> 00:17:35,226
I can't believe we have
our own factory now.

235
00:17:51,832 --> 00:17:52,445
Winry.

236
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:55,659
Listen, about Al...

237
00:17:56,966 --> 00:17:57,906
He already left?

238
00:17:58,326 --> 00:17:58,826
Really?

239
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:00,173
Yes.

240
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,579
He said he had
his own factory now.

241
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,980
Do you need any help?

242
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,340
It's been two years.

243
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,620
I'm used to him by now.

244
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:15,939
You can move them that much?

245
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:17,759
Yeah, the simple stuff.

246
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,820
My arm and leg are gone, but my brain's
still sending out signals to move them.

247
00:18:22,821 --> 00:18:26,000
These machines take those
signals and amplify them.

248
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:29,415
To be honest, I
don't understand it all.

249
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,140
My dad's the one who made them.

250
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,660
Where is your father?

251
00:18:33,375 --> 00:18:34,235
I don't know.

252
00:18:34,546 --> 00:18:36,766
One day he just left
and never came back.

253
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,160
So I ended up living
here with Alphonse.

254
00:18:39,526 --> 00:18:43,166
We became friends when we studied
rocketry together with Dr. Oberth.

255
00:18:48,592 --> 00:18:49,152
Armor.

256
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:53,306
I saw a suit of armor
walking beside you.

257
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,299
Then you looking
up at a smiling face.

258
00:18:56,993 --> 00:18:58,473
That must have been your mother.

259
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,260
And then... a village on
a hill in a grassy plain.

260
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,380
You said these visions are unscientific, but
to me they're as clear as this stairway now.

261
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,680
Please, tell me
about this other world.

262
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,880
What is it like there?

263
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,380
The same as this
one, pretty much.

264
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,480
Names for things are a little different,
and the places aren't the same.

265
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:24,060
But I've seen a whole
lot of familiar faces.

266
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:28,240
So if that other world's your
home, then why are you here?

267
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:33,180
In the world that I'm from,
my younger brother was killed.

268
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,440
In trying to bring him
back, I wound up here.

269
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,620
It seems that's the
price I had to pay.

270
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Or maybe not.

271
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:43,760
Maybe this is just the hell I've been
allotted for trying the Forbidden again.

272
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:47,226
Two years ago, I met the
Alphonse who lives here.

273
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,580
Alphonse Heiderich.

274
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,160
And if my brother
Al had grown up...

275
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,320
I'm sure he'd look
exactly the same.

276
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:57,035
So who knows what
is and isn't science.

277
00:19:57,272 --> 00:19:59,172
Maybe this whole
world's just a dream.

278
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,420
Good morning, Gracia.

279
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,160
Good morning, Edward.

280
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,540
Oh, there you go
with that face again.

281
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,540
Who do I remind you of?

282
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,340
Your mother?

283
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,900
Or is it a girlfriend?

284
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,740
It's nothing, really.

285
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,260
Oh, thanks for lending
Noah these clothes.

286
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,920
Mm-hmm.

287
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,500
So you two are going out today?

288
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,060
Just be careful, all right?

289
00:20:33,895 --> 00:20:34,735
Did you hear?

290
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,160
They're saying we have to pay our
taxes in gold now instead of marks.

291
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:41,103
You know it's bad when the
people who print it don't want it.

292
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,733
All these marks won't
even buy me a beer.

293
00:20:44,013 --> 00:20:44,775
Burn them, then.

294
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,580
Yeah, right.

295
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,500
Then what would I slap you with?

296
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
If you don't want them,
just give them to me.

297
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:52,460
That's okay, Hughes.

298
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,980
I got it saved for retirement.

299
00:20:54,739 --> 00:20:55,359
Hey!

300
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:56,292
Edward!

301
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,159
Edward!

302
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,050
Morning, Officer Hughes.

303
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:13,390
You do know that girl who's
moved in with you is a Gypsy, right?

304
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,050
I hadn't noticed.

305
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:16,970
Watch out.

306
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,170
You and Alphonse think you're being noble by
helping someone in need, but that's her game.

307
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:22,950
Gypsies are smooth talkers.

308
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,282
What?

309
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,970
They trick men to steal their wallets,
then they're on to their next Mark.

310
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,610
They are drifters, after all.

311
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,250
Well, I'm a drifter, too.

312
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,910
Look, I'm telling
you this as a friend.

313
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,290
If something bad happens,
it'll be trouble for Gracia.

314
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,630
Well, how about this?

315
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,930
Confess your love to her
instead of bothering us.

316
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,010
Save you some time.

317
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:42,690
Trust me, she'll
be good for you.

318
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,830
Have you ever heard of
respecting your elders, Ed?

319
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,340
I don't think I'm being hustled.

320
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,480
There are all sorts of people who'd like the
power to see into human hearts with a touch.

321
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:03,460
Especially in this country,
with all that's going on.

322
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,160
And I think they would
chase you down to get it.

323
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,320
So you believe my gift is real?

324
00:22:08,321 --> 00:22:10,880
A suit of armor
walking beside me.

325
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,760
I've never told
anyone here about that.

326
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,760
Not even Alphonse.

327
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,920
You had my hand.

328
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,058
What did you see this time?

329
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,080
Nothing strong, really.

330
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,900
My power works best
when people are asleep.

331
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:25,100
Oh yeah?

332
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:25,940
Why's that?

333
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,980
Because when they're sleeping,
I can see what they dream.

334
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,040
The Berlin government
is spineless.

335
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:35,620
They have no intention of
protecting Germany at all.

336
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,820
What can they really do?

337
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,020
Germany lost the war.

338
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,820
We can't complain about
our territory being taken.

339
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,380
Germany didn't lose.

340
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,020
The Communists and the Jews just
surrendered before we could finish it.

341
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,005
- Don't get so
worked up. Hey Noah,

342
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:48,880
- It's not good for you.
Can i have my coat?

343
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,380
What's wrong with you?

344
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,320
Get her out of here!

345
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,200
Why should I?

346
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,560
Gypsies like her
are just like the Jews!

347
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,680
They don't have their own country, so
they come into ours and steal our money

348
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,720
and our jobs until
there's nothing left to take!

349
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,400
They're just a
race of parasites!

350
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,930
I'm sure it gets to you.

351
00:23:24,931 --> 00:23:26,546
hearing speeches like that.

352
00:23:26,983 --> 00:23:27,843
Not really.

353
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:31,125
My people have gotten used
to ignorance about who we are.

354
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,050
The name Gypsy comes from a myth we
spread that we were fortune-tellers from Egypt.

355
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:41,510
Bohemians, Satanos, Cowleys, Sigourners,
Nomads... Outsiders can call us what they want.

356
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:43,845
I see.

357
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:45,610
But then how do you
refer to yourselves?

358
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:47,310
You must have some name.

359
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,570
Roma.

360
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:49,690
Roma?

361
00:23:51,276 --> 00:23:52,736
It's our word for human.

362
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,338
I'll see you back at
the apartment, okay?

363
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,820
Wait, what's wrong?

364
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:18,351
Why?

365
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:20,080
Why is a Homunculus here?

366
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,460
Very funny.

367
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,720
A rock in the road.

368
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:30,480
Kids in this country need
something better to do with their time.

369
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:40,750
Führer Bradley.

370
00:24:41,390 --> 00:24:41,830
Führer?

371
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,830
But if you made it here after the
General's assault, that means he...

372
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:49,750
General?

373
00:24:49,751 --> 00:24:51,450
Are you talking about the war?

374
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:52,770
Don't play dumb with me!

375
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:55,770
Your left eye.

376
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:56,610
Let me see it.

377
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:57,870
If you insist.

378
00:25:05,092 --> 00:25:05,532
Thanks.

379
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,380
Of course.

380
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,980
That would make sense.

381
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,280
Homunculi take the appearance of
the human they were meant to replace.

382
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,640
So if those people survived here,
then they would look like them too.

383
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:18,360
Mistook for someone else?

384
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,140
Yeah.

385
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,780
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,599
I'm Jewish, so
I'm used to worse.

387
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:27,699
Men in this country have convinced themselves that I'm
some conniving aristocrat, try to take me for all I'm worth.

388
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,340
Anyhow, do you by chance
know how to drive a car?

389
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:32,940
More or less.

390
00:25:33,313 --> 00:25:35,693
Then perhaps you'll be
so kind as to take his place.

391
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,240
At least until he wakes up.

392
00:25:59,103 --> 00:26:00,180
Magnificent.

393
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,700
With that propulsion system,
we'll have a ship in no time.

394
00:26:03,701 --> 00:26:05,020
Look at you all.

395
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,220
Blonde hair, blue eyes.

396
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,480
You are the model of the ancient Aryan
race and the pride of the German people.

397
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:14,940
I'm sure Chairman Eckhart will be
most delighted with your progress.

398
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,700
We've located the
Great Serpent, Professor.

399
00:26:23,355 --> 00:26:24,935
Is it true, Chairman Eckhart?

400
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,900
You've learned where
the Great Serpent has fled?

401
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,860
It seems so.

402
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,480
We have an eyewitness report.

403
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,440
Lieutenant Hess, take charge.

404
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,280
Ma'am.

405
00:26:35,015 --> 00:26:38,495
The time for our passage into
Shamballa draws near, Professor.

406
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,220
Actually, this couldn't
have worked out better.

407
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,300
I've been looking for a capable person like
yourself who could give me a little muscle.

408
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,480
You got people coming
after you or something?

409
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,820
To the contrary.

410
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,688
I'm the one who's hunting.

411
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,260
A dragon, to be exact.

412
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,060
A dragon?

413
00:27:23,617 --> 00:27:27,260
By the way, you can call me
Mabuse, and I'll pay you a fair rate.

414
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:51,155
Here.

415
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,040
Rumor is some would-be burglar broke into
this abandoned castle, and that's when he saw it.

416
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,540
Saw what?

417
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:03,760
Well, the dragon.

418
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,280
I know.

419
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,400
It's foolish.

420
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,280
Most people say
it was just a snake.

421
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,980
You came all the way here
on a rumor from a scared thief?

422
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,480
I have my reasons.

423
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,800
The idea of finding a living, breathing
dragon is quite appealing to me.

424
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,860
Why, are you gonna
slay it, get knighted?

425
00:28:30,686 --> 00:28:32,426
Talk about a wild goose chase.

426
00:28:58,610 --> 00:28:59,810
Edward Elric.

427
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,623
Who said that?

428
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,510
I've been looking for you.

429
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,412
Have you missed me?

430
00:29:18,145 --> 00:29:19,778
Is that really you Envy?

431
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:27,250
So this is what happened to you,
when you crossed through the gate?

432
00:29:27,477 --> 00:29:29,077
Take me to Hohenheim!

433
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:30,810
To our father!

434
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:40,520
It's the one thing I thought I was safe
from in this world, fighting Homunculi like you!

435
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,380
Those fighters? Who are they?

436
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,553
All lancers to battle positions!

437
00:30:37,595 --> 00:30:38,255
Fire!

438
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:49,790
These lancers were forged from the true spear
of Longinus and scattered throughout the world.

439
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:53,030
It has taken a great deal
of effort to gather them all.

440
00:30:59,415 --> 00:31:00,155
Hold on!

441
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,960
Just tell me what
you're gonna do with him!

442
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,400
I suggest you forget
what you've seen here.

443
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,200
It's not something ordinary
people need to know.

444
00:31:07,814 --> 00:31:08,707
Haushofer?

445
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,480
Have you forgotten me?

446
00:31:11,481 --> 00:31:13,560
I guess that's no
surprise, General.

447
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:16,940
We haven't seen each other since
before the war, when we met in Japan.

448
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,020
I heard you were lecturing
at Munich University now.

449
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,180
I'd been meaning to stop
by, but with my scav...

450
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:24,820
Haushofer?

451
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,240
I've heard that
name from my father.

452
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,480
And you are?

453
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,480
Edward Elric.

454
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,300
Nice to meet you.

455
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,880
My father's name is Hohenheim.

456
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:42,620
Have you seen him?

457
00:31:54,446 --> 00:31:56,766
This is an important
victory, Professor.

458
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:59,920
Now the Great Serpent is
once again in our possession.

459
00:32:00,906 --> 00:32:02,846
He said he was Edward Elric.

460
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,440
And what does that mean?

461
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,840
It means that he's
Hohenheim's true son.

462
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:09,379
Our Hohenheim?

463
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:10,246
But how?

464
00:32:10,301 --> 00:32:12,580
His sons are from Shambhala.

465
00:32:12,615 --> 00:32:13,475
Yes.

466
00:32:14,033 --> 00:32:17,466
To think another person has
safely passed through the gate.

467
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:33,603
Pale white and black,

468
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:35,786
with false citrine

469
00:32:36,383 --> 00:32:39,463
imperfect white and red,

470
00:32:39,743 --> 00:32:41,763
The Peacock's
feathers in bright colors,

471
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,210
The rainbow extending
across the sky above,

472
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,550
the spotted leopard,
the green lion,

473
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,750
The crow's bill, blue as lead.

474
00:32:54,685 --> 00:32:55,865
My son.

475
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,450
How nice to see you.

476
00:33:04,876 --> 00:33:06,856
Professor, time to try.

477
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:11,710
Chairman, even with the armor protecting them, they
have little hope of passing through the gate untainted.

478
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,520
To Shambhala!

479
00:33:54,803 --> 00:33:55,532
General!

480
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:56,710
General Mustang!

481
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,690
Where are you?

482
00:33:57,730 --> 00:33:58,150
It's us!

483
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,670
Lieutenant Havok.

484
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:03,530
Lieutenant Breda.

485
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,010
It's good to see you again.

486
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:05,976
Thanks for coming out.

487
00:34:07,685 --> 00:34:09,905
By the way, you
can drop the general.

488
00:34:09,930 --> 00:34:10,810
I gave that up.

489
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,510
I'm just an enlisted man now.

490
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,530
Right, I forgot.

491
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:15,470
I guess we outrank you now.

492
00:34:18,145 --> 00:34:19,745
I know it was your choice, sir.

493
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,847
Volunteering for an outpost
way out here in the sticks.

494
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,450
But still... I plan to do all I can
for my country in my own way.

495
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:26,516
End of discussion.

496
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,370
Matches?

497
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,530
I haven't used Alchemy
once since that day.

498
00:34:42,910 --> 00:34:44,270
I gave that up too.

499
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:46,270
But you're the
Flame Alchemist, sir.

500
00:34:47,225 --> 00:34:48,725
I start to now and then.

501
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:53,370
But each time I try, I see the faces of all the
innocent people who died because of my mistakes.

502
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:55,710
That's what this eye sees.

503
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:00,270
Maybe Lieutenant Hawkeye
should have come, too.

504
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,270
She always knows
how to talk to him.

505
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,510
Don't kid yourself.

506
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,270
She wouldn't come.

507
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:06,410
I doubt she'd want to
see Mustang like that.

508
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:10,970
Besides, I get the feeling the
lieutenant isn't the one he's waiting for.

509
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,390
What do you mean?

510
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:14,210
Oh.

511
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:23,530
Two months ago, she finally
got so bad that she couldn't move.

512
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:27,670
She told Al to go, that there
was nothing left to teach him.

513
00:35:28,030 --> 00:35:29,590
She just didn't want him to see.

514
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:30,830
I'm sorry.

515
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:32,745
And Al?

516
00:35:32,883 --> 00:35:35,043
He still hasn't given
up on finding Edward?

517
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:36,570
Not at all.

518
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,930
He can't be dissuaded.

519
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:40,210
He's convinced that
Ed is alive somewhere.

520
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,690
He says he has these
dreams, where he's seventeen.

521
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,490
And he coughs the
way Izumi always did.

522
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,890
And he lives with
Ed in a bustling city.

523
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:52,330
The two of them design machines
together that fly up into space.

524
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,120
Take good care of them for me.

525
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:24,405
Looks like someone
needs some maintenance.

526
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:25,850
Let me help.

527
00:37:05,092 --> 00:37:09,380
The Armstrong Foundation will work with
you all, in every aspect of the continuing

528
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:15,660
reconstruction of Lior, building a thriving Metropolis
that will rival even Central in its beauty and splendor.

529
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,340
We will press forward with great diligence to
create a city that will exemplify the East in this new era.

530
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,790
I offer this shop as a
gift between friends.

531
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:36,270
Wow, yeah, that's
really something.

532
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,950
that a transmutation circle?

533
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:56,170
Everyone, get inside.

534
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:03,350
Alchemy almost wiped
this city off the map.

535
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,750
Who would dare use it now?

536
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
Soldiers, but where
are they coming from?

537
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,710
He's making tornadoes.

538
00:38:39,997 --> 00:38:40,956
With Alchemy.

539
00:38:45,438 --> 00:38:46,478
It's Al.

540
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,600
Lior, this is Central.

541
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,220
Do you copy?

542
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:07,980
Lior!

543
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,100
There's an
earthquake in Lior too?

544
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,020
At the exact same
time as this one?

545
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,340
There are also reports of
enemy soldiers appearing there.

546
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,760
Though it hasn't been confirmed.

547
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,680
We have tight security
on the eastern border.

548
00:39:18,681 --> 00:39:21,220
How could an enemy
cross without us knowing?

549
00:39:25,766 --> 00:39:26,506
Watch out!

550
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,390
Alphonse Elric.

551
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,470
You look well.

552
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,590
This is Major Armstrong, Al.

553
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,790
He's your friend, remember?

554
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,010
Rose!

555
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,370
Of course, Major.

556
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,630
I've heard about you.

557
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:53,350
You helped us on
our journey, right?

558
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,570
So you still haven't recovered
your memory of those years?

559
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,430
What was that?

560
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:09,210
I'm controlling the
suits of armor I touched.

561
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,630
I transferred a portion
of my soul into them.

562
00:40:12,050 --> 00:40:13,370
A portion of your soul?

563
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,750
Oh, don't worry.

564
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:15,230
I'm fine.

565
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:17,370
For some reason, it just
comes naturally to me.

566
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,970
Poor Al.

567
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,250
All those lost memories.

568
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:25,070
Four years spent
with his brother.

569
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:34,130
Still, seeing how he's progressed, it's as if
Edward's been leading him every step of the way.

570
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,280
The men inside
the armor are dead.

571
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,560
And apparently they've been dead
since before they reached the surface.

572
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,120
Dead from what?

573
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,000
I don't know.

574
00:40:50,346 --> 00:40:53,386
They seem to have been subjected
to extreme levels of pressure.

575
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,760
So, are you really
still looking for him?

576
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:00,620
Yeah.

577
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,480
But Al, he's gone.

578
00:41:20,301 --> 00:41:22,687
Let go, you'll dissapear too!

579
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:38,800
Look, it's the only way for the Inspector
General in Bavaria to take us seriously.

580
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,420
Gracia, about that Gypsy...

581
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,760
That went well.

582
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:45,533
But why?

583
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,640
Do you think there's
going to be another war?

584
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,680
I don't know.

585
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,360
I certainly hope not, but
there's a lot of talk right now.

586
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,200
And if it did happen, God forbid,
your people could be in danger.

587
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,240
There are men saying they want to reshape the country
so it's just authentic Germans and kick out everyone else.

588
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:04,713
Officer?

589
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,460
What were you telling her about?

590
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,100
Nothing much.

591
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,140
What's wrong?

592
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,220
You look so serious.

593
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,860
Just doing my job to
keep the streets safe.

594
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,920
You never know what
these Gypsies are scheming.

595
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,940
I could say the same for you
and your friends at the beer hall.

596
00:42:21,333 --> 00:42:23,373
You're scheming about
something every day.

597
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:25,515
Please, Hughes.

598
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,900
She's a vulnerable girl.

599
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:28,900
Can't you keep her safe?

600
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,000
It was a betrayal.

601
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,040
Germany still had a real
chance to win the war.

602
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,920
Yet the government just gave
up, stabbing us in the back.

603
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,820
And then the Treaty of
Versailles was a total humiliation.

604
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:47,920
There are a lot of people who think we should
overthrow the government and take back Germany's pride.

605
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:52,330
Tell me, Alphonse, do you happen to work
for the people who think those sorts of things?

606
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:55,486
I just want to build
rockets, nothing more.

607
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,380
So where's Ed?

608
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:01,980
Did he say something
about going to the university?

609
00:43:01,981 --> 00:43:02,780
Yes.

610
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,620
He's looking for someone.

611
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,840
It's exactly like
Michi's Superman.

612
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:11,320
Professor Haushofer's
lectures are all canceled.

613
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,720
He's at his villa, I think.

614
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,500
Rumor has it he's too busy
with the Thule Society now.

615
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:16,800
Thule Society?

616
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,480
Yeah, you haven't heard of it?

617
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:22,300
Thule's a mystical island in the north
that was written about in ancient mythology.

618
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:25,120
The Thule Society wants to
harness the power of the gods who

619
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,060
dwell on the island, and reclaim
the destiny of the Aryan race.

620
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:36,325
Ancient gods?

621
00:43:36,350 --> 00:43:37,210
The occult?

622
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:39,710
How are they going to save
their country with a myth?

623
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,770
Dammit, there sure are a lot of
guards in the professor's place.

624
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:12,385
Those rockets?

625
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,430
Don't tell me these are
Alphonse's sponsors?

626
00:44:42,427 --> 00:44:44,887
Looks like some kind
of sorcery diagram.

627
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:49,780
Probably for sacrificing virgins and
summoning demons from inside the Earth.

628
00:44:50,639 --> 00:44:52,079
These guys are hopeless.

629
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,340
Hold on.

630
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,380
That's no spell.

631
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:56,680
It's Alchemy.

632
00:44:59,853 --> 00:45:00,793
But why?

633
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,740
Alchemy's not supposed to
work on this side of the gate.

634
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,260
But the circle's not done.

635
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,300
It's worn down.

636
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,820
What am I doing this for?

637
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:32,700
Finished or not, it
won't make a difference.

638
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:35,573
Guess I'm just a
sucker for nostalgia.

639
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:48,870
Still just a puppet,
aren't you, pipsqueak?

640
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,390
Envy!

641
00:46:02,899 --> 00:46:04,239
Shamballa.

642
00:46:12,809 --> 00:46:13,949
What's going on here?

643
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,240
I didn't do any of this!

644
00:46:15,779 --> 00:46:16,299
Go!

645
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,762
What the hell?

646
00:46:20,830 --> 00:46:21,510
Don't move!

647
00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:23,490
Why did the portal reopen now?

648
00:46:23,770 --> 00:46:26,690
We've never been able to do it
twice, no matter what we tried!

649
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,530
They've come back to us.

650
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:29,610
From Shamballa.

651
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,090
What did you say?

652
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:33,770
We'll ask the questions.

653
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:34,950
What have you done?

654
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,010
Check them out.

655
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,030
See if they're okay.

656
00:46:41,197 --> 00:46:42,337
He's been crushed.

657
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,825
This man is dead too, sir.

658
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:45,850
Any survivors?

659
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:50,110
My god... Is this
your doing, boy?

660
00:46:53,705 --> 00:46:57,145
In the Hollow Earth lies a
vast underground kingdom.

661
00:46:57,170 --> 00:47:01,375
Far greater than any civilization the
surface has known in modern times.

662
00:47:01,648 --> 00:47:05,570
A utopia without war or
illness, suffering or hate.

663
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:09,130
The wisdom of its inhabitants
promises absolute peace.

664
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:14,670
While the mystical power of its army
guarantees victory in mankind's final war.

665
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:18,170
The road to
Shamballa is difficult.

666
00:47:18,810 --> 00:47:21,170
It seems your hypothesis
was correct, Professor.

667
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:23,030
A lucky guess, Chairman.

668
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,750
This is the boy I
was telling you about.

669
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:28,390
Hello, Edward Elric.

670
00:47:28,391 --> 00:47:31,950
Your father was once part of
our society and still helps today.

671
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:35,510
I don't know where he is
or what he told you, lady.

672
00:47:35,770 --> 00:47:38,610
My name is Delinda
Eckhart, thank you.

673
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:39,690
Thule Island.

674
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:40,910
Kingdom of Shamballa.

675
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,510
You people seem to be obsessed
with any world but this one.

676
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:46,350
Guess we have that in common.

677
00:47:49,185 --> 00:47:50,225
Stop it, Hess.

678
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,030
His plans for
Germany are in motion.

679
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:54,470
What if this boy tells
our secrets to Berlin?

680
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:00,183
We might need him!

681
00:48:10,132 --> 00:48:10,712
Brother?

682
00:48:13,966 --> 00:48:14,546
Brother!

683
00:48:18,846 --> 00:48:19,426
Brother!

684
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,640
Oh, brother, I'm
so glad to see you.

685
00:48:22,660 --> 00:48:23,352
It's been so long.

686
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,900
Are you okay?

687
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,080
I can't breathe!

688
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,675
But you've changed.

689
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:29,940
You're taller now.

690
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:31,355
Al

691
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:35,795
What, you thought I'd still be
a runt when I'm 18 years old?

692
00:48:36,224 --> 00:48:37,100
The Suit's empty.

693
00:48:37,456 --> 00:48:39,055
But how is that possible?

694
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:39,940
I don't know.

695
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,540
It could be some form
of Alchemy, perhaps.

696
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:44,100
Don't you see?

697
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,840
It's possessed by a demon!

698
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:46,680
Fire!

699
00:48:49,058 --> 00:48:50,415
They don't seem too happy.

700
00:48:50,615 --> 00:48:52,095
You haven't changed, brother.

701
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,320
You're still causing trouble.

702
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,380
Save the lecture.

703
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,360
Let's get out of here, right.

704
00:49:04,802 --> 00:49:05,605
Now what?

705
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:06,150
Just go!

706
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:07,070
Which way?

707
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,030
Anywhere!

708
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:09,710
I don't know where I'm going!

709
00:49:09,910 --> 00:49:10,872
Better than getting shot!

710
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:14,510
I'm sorry, ma'am.

711
00:49:14,850 --> 00:49:17,110
He's escaped, but we
know where to find him.

712
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:19,410
He's been living with
Alphonse Heiderich.

713
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:22,070
His knowledge of Alchemy
could be our answer.

714
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,130
But I doubt that he'll
willingly cooperate with us.

715
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:26,970
He's just like his father.

716
00:49:27,350 --> 00:49:29,650
Then why don't we
use the Gypsy, ma'am?

717
00:49:29,790 --> 00:49:30,410
That girl?

718
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,190
Yes.

719
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:34,490
We've received a tip from
one of our loyal party members.

720
00:49:34,491 --> 00:49:38,610
The girl's living with Edward and
Alphonse, too, now, as luck would have it.

721
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:39,810
It's not luck.

722
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:43,770
The gods of the Aryan race
are lighting a path for us.

723
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,390
You're actually planning
on going through with this?

724
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:50,190
There's no evidence to confirm it's
Shamballa on the other side of that portal!

725
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:52,330
You saw what the
trip did to our men!

726
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:54,630
November 8th is only
ten days away, sir.

727
00:49:54,850 --> 00:49:58,110
The Führer plans to make his move
with or without the Thule Society.

728
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:01,156
Our role in the
party hinges on this.

729
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:02,630
Relax, Lieutenant.

730
00:50:03,269 --> 00:50:05,409
The portal will be
opened on that day.

731
00:50:05,610 --> 00:50:08,550
The Thule Society led
the world into a new age.

732
00:50:09,050 --> 00:50:11,270
That's what the future
generations will say.

733
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:16,873
What's with you, Al?

734
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:20,100
You finally come back
home and all you do is sleep?

735
00:50:21,860 --> 00:50:22,380
Brother...

736
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,020
I've dreamed of this place.

737
00:50:34,340 --> 00:50:35,120
It's pretty.

738
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,200
Are we really in the gate?

739
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:37,920
No.

740
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,760
We're on the other side of it.

741
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,840
But forget that.

742
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:44,320
I want to hear
about your life, Al.

743
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,980
That is really you, right?

744
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,920
How did you get stuck
in that armor again?

745
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:49,760
Again?

746
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:50,600
What do you mean?

747
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:52,060
Oh, right.

748
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:55,600
You attached my soul to
armor just like this, didn't you?

749
00:50:56,239 --> 00:50:58,039
While my body
was lost in the gate.

750
00:50:58,620 --> 00:50:59,360
Sorry, brother.

751
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:01,560
I don't remember any of that.

752
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,240
You don't remember?

753
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,880
What?

754
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:07,080
The last time I saw you was the
day we tried to bring Mom back.

755
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,380
Then I woke up
and I was in Central.

756
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,480
And a girl named Rose
was taking me home.

757
00:51:13,793 --> 00:51:18,033
But as confused as I was, I knew
you were alive out there, somewhere.

758
00:51:18,513 --> 00:51:20,993
And one day, we'd
be together again.

759
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,780
And now?

760
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,720
I wonder how they
opened that portal.

761
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,240
Will they do it again?

762
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:26,940
Al?

763
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,880
Brother, the transmutation I used to
transfer my soul, it doesn't last for long.

764
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:35,120
It looks like I've
run out of time.

765
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,420
Al, don't go yet.

766
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,400
It's too soon.

767
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:39,880
It's okay.

768
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,520
I think I know how to
bring you back now.

769
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:44,320
That portal they used.

770
00:51:44,520 --> 00:51:46,540
I'll try to open it
from my side, too.

771
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:47,000
Al!

772
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:05,670
You're awfully late.

773
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:07,870
What's with the smirk?

774
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:08,990
Something good happen?

775
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:11,070
Yeah, actually.

776
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:13,190
You're probably not
gonna believe this.

777
00:52:13,685 --> 00:52:15,105
But I saw him tonight.

778
00:52:15,130 --> 00:52:16,650
I saw my brother Al.

779
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:20,250
And there's a chance I'll be
able to leave this world after all.

780
00:52:28,413 --> 00:52:28,933
Hello?

781
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,380
Mabuse, what's going on?

782
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:33,720
Mabuse?

783
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:38,040
I understand you've been sniffing
around General Haushofer's place.

784
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,940
What?

785
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,020
You part of their club?

786
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:42,120
There's something I'd
like to talk to you about.

787
00:52:42,573 --> 00:52:44,453
Meet me at Ufa, in Berlin.

788
00:52:49,016 --> 00:52:50,056
Hey, Alphonse.

789
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,730
Have you ever heard of Ufa?

790
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:52,530
Sure.

791
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:56,030
You'll excuse me for
not keeping in touch.

792
00:52:56,310 --> 00:52:56,930
I'm sorry.

793
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:59,190
I realize I'm in no
position to call you.

794
00:52:59,191 --> 00:53:00,310
No, it's fine.

795
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,930
But Al isn't here.

796
00:53:02,110 --> 00:53:02,430
Really?

797
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:03,750
He was for a while.

798
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:05,010
But he's disappeared.

799
00:53:05,230 --> 00:53:06,050
He and Wrath both.

800
00:53:06,410 --> 00:53:07,190
I see.

801
00:53:08,356 --> 00:53:10,276
They've probably
gone to Central, then.

802
00:53:10,370 --> 00:53:10,670
Huh?

803
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:15,550
Lior and Central, experiencing the
same phenomenon at the exact same time.

804
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,150
There's one thing they share.

805
00:53:17,510 --> 00:53:20,870
And it's a pretty safe bet Al
arrived at the same conclusion I did.

806
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:25,030
Does this have anything to do with Ed's
disappearance and Al trying to bring him back?

807
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,950
I've said all I can for now.

808
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:34,540
Winry, can't you wait here for him
to come back like we always have?

809
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:36,360
I'm sorry, but not this time.

810
00:53:36,940 --> 00:53:38,120
He's looking for Ed.

811
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,000
And I can't let
him do that alone.

812
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,020
Okay, now it makes sense.

813
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:53,040
Considering the work it took to rig this, I
can see why you wanted to film the real thing.

814
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,540
Still, I can't complain.

815
00:53:54,780 --> 00:53:57,320
Just seeing it helped me make
the fake one a great deal better.

816
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,560
Dr. Mabuse.

817
00:54:04,561 --> 00:54:04,600
Dr. Mabuse.

818
00:54:04,601 --> 00:54:05,340
Mabuse the gambler.

819
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,060
I understand that's
a film you made.

820
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,180
Just having a
little fun with you.

821
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:12,620
Call me Fritz
Lang if you prefer.

822
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:20,680
I'm toying with the idea of leaving this
country and moving to America for a while.

823
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:25,620
I've been reading American novels and
publications to sort of get myself in the mood.

824
00:54:25,915 --> 00:54:29,995
They have a great deal of science
fiction or scientific romance, as some call it.

825
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,240
And there's an idea in a recent
book that Wrather caught my eye.

826
00:54:33,241 --> 00:54:38,380
They call it a parallel world, an
entire planet existing side by side

827
00:54:38,381 --> 00:54:41,660
with ours, separate yet
connected by some invisible force.

828
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:47,020
They might share similarities of history and
people, but with some fundamental difference.

829
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,700
Maybe it's a realm where
magic and dragons do exist.

830
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:54,600
Or I don't know, maybe where Alchemy triumphed
over physics and paved the whole world in gold.

831
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:58,640
And maybe, given those
rules, Fritz Lang isn't a director.

832
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,440
Maybe he's a criminal walking
around with the same face as mine.

833
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:04,560
Or for that matter,
maybe he's a woman.

834
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,520
Imagine, it's fun to
think about it, isn't it?

835
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,440
Any place like that would
just feel like a fantasy.

836
00:55:10,860 --> 00:55:11,540
You think so?

837
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,540
But then how would you know which
world is make-believe and which one is real?

838
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:17,760
Believe me, you just would.

839
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:22,800
You'll never know what it's like
spending your whole life in a dream.

840
00:55:39,009 --> 00:55:40,509
So what did you want to discuss?

841
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:43,110
The Major General
Karl Haushofer's book.

842
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:45,610
I met him in the Empire
of Japan before the war.

843
00:55:45,611 --> 00:55:46,842
While he was doing his research.

844
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:52,736
His thesis is that the island has success
because it was made up entirely of a single race.

845
00:55:53,730 --> 00:55:55,690
Germany, meanwhile,
is disjointed.

846
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,390
Its people are spread far
beyond its own borders.

847
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,630
Scattered throughout Poland, Austria,
and many other countries across Europe.

848
00:56:03,550 --> 00:56:07,310
Haushofer believes those nations
should be unified and then distilled.

849
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:09,970
Creating a homeland
for the true German race.

850
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,310
Sorry, I think I'll pass.

851
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,010
Hold on, Ed.

852
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:13,670
There's more.

853
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:18,090
Haushofer also writes
about a utopia, Shamballa.

854
00:56:18,350 --> 00:56:23,050
It's a legend in the Orient, and it's said
that those who rule it can rule the world.

855
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:25,610
This society of
his believes that.

856
00:56:25,910 --> 00:56:27,030
And what do you believe?

857
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:30,270
Do you know what
this device is, Ed?

858
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:31,290
What?

859
00:56:34,990 --> 00:56:40,390
Not long ago, the Thule Society helped form
the National Socialist Workers' Party in Germany.

860
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,870
Which still serves an
active role in their ranks.

861
00:56:42,871 --> 00:56:46,830
Playing in the name of rival
socialists, they're called Nazis for short.

862
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:47,730
Nazis?

863
00:56:48,350 --> 00:56:52,810
The party is supposedly planning a
large-scale uprising sometime in November.

864
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:56,770
The consensus in important circles is
that they don't have enough supporters,

865
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,370
and that Berlin's forces
will quickly put them down.

866
00:56:59,690 --> 00:57:02,010
The Thule Society,
however, disagrees.

867
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:06,270
They have guaranteed victory to
their leader, who they call the Führer.

868
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:09,890
And as proof of their claim, that
picture is what they showed him.

869
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:12,690
They say it's a bomb.

870
00:57:12,691 --> 00:57:13,990
A bomb of devastating power.

871
00:57:15,310 --> 00:57:20,970
They also say it relies on a scientific
principle never before conceived in this world.

872
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:26,670
Haushofer and the others claim that if
they're given enough funding and power,

873
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:32,970
they'll be able to bring weapons of this magnitude one after
another through the portal, creating an unstoppable force.

874
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,650
They want to use the other
world for their uprising?

875
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:38,130
What are you planning now?

876
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:39,750
I can't let them do that!

877
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,390
I have to close
that gate for good!

878
00:57:41,391 --> 00:57:42,630
Let them be.

879
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,790
If they want a war, you can't
do anything to stop them.

880
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,770
I just told you as a warning, so
you'd know to keep your distance.

881
00:57:49,410 --> 00:57:51,190
You should come to
work for me instead.

882
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:54,730
Hold on, how do you know so
much about these Nazis anyway?

883
00:57:55,470 --> 00:58:00,730
This Führer, Adolf Hitler, is a charismatic
man, and my wife has become a fanatical believer.

884
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:05,170
Through her, the Nazis have asked me to
work with them many times, but I'm no fool.

885
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:09,090
I'm one of the Jews they want to get
rid of, and after they exploited my talents,

886
00:58:09,210 --> 00:58:10,130
they cast me aside.

887
00:58:10,131 --> 00:58:11,890
So I cast them off first.

888
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:15,490
Reality is just a knotted
mess I choose to avoid.

889
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,310
You act like you're too good for the
world, but really you're just afraid of the risk!

890
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,870
Just trying to avoid being
forced out of your dream!

891
00:58:29,972 --> 00:58:32,938
Wait... where are you taking me?

892
00:58:43,266 --> 00:58:46,686
What we're offering isn't
nearly as bad as you think, Noah.

893
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:48,233
Just hear us out.

894
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,680
The Führer plans to use
the stormtroopers on the 8th.

895
00:59:11,100 --> 00:59:11,760
Goering's men?

896
00:59:12,080 --> 00:59:14,800
You're saying we won't be
involved in the uprising now?

897
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,800
On the day they make their move,
we'll open the path to Shamballa.

898
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:18,980
That's perfect!

899
00:59:19,300 --> 00:59:21,100
We already have
the Gypsy persuaded.

900
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,460
I'll speed up the plans.

901
00:59:28,887 --> 00:59:31,127
They've set our launch
date for November 8th.

902
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:33,860
And Hess told me it's crucial
that we're ready on time.

903
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,740
So, let's make Germany proud.

904
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,060
Let's show them
we're not beaten yet.

905
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:42,980
Isn't that what you said?

906
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,700
If the portal opens,
you can go home, right?

907
00:59:46,340 --> 00:59:47,440
And that's what you want?

908
00:59:47,780 --> 00:59:48,960
Not at that cost.

909
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:51,920
Those zealots would follow me
and drag my world into their war.

910
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:52,820
But...

911
00:59:53,540 --> 00:59:56,300
I'm positive now that
Al's alive on the other side.

912
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:58,680
I never knew that for sure.

913
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,340
I was afraid my
survival meant I failed.

914
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:05,520
So now, knowing
that, I can bear it.

915
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,660
Alphonse, I need to talk to you.

916
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:14,640
These people, your
sponsors, they're bad news.

917
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,640
You need to stop
building their rockets.

918
01:00:19,755 --> 01:00:21,435
Our work's in the final stage.

919
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,240
I'll be sleeping
at the factory now.

920
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:23,960
Wait!

921
01:00:24,140 --> 01:00:25,800
Your sponsors
are plotting a war!

922
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:28,260
They're gonna start
by invading my world.

923
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,520
And those rockets must
have something to do with it!

924
01:00:30,860 --> 01:00:31,700
Listen to me!

925
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,490
The truth is

926
01:00:49,491 --> 01:00:50,414
I'm running out of time.

927
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:52,910
You say this world's not yours?

928
01:00:52,990 --> 01:00:55,690
Well, it is mine, and I want
to leave proof that I lived in it!

929
01:00:55,810 --> 01:00:58,110
It's a bit late for you
to start caring now!

930
01:01:02,142 --> 01:01:03,096
Alphonse!

931
01:01:06,086 --> 01:01:08,226
They don't know how to
open the portal anyway.

932
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:09,660
Right.

933
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:51,090
So you're not even sure
if Al's in Central or not?

934
01:01:51,430 --> 01:01:52,530
That's why I'm worried.

935
01:01:52,690 --> 01:01:55,930
I only think Wrath is with them because
they disappeared at the same time.

936
01:01:56,550 --> 01:01:59,130
Izumi's death seems to have
been a relief for Al in a way.

937
01:01:59,131 --> 01:02:01,190
Like he's free to
concentrate on finding Ed.

938
01:02:01,370 --> 01:02:02,370
Don't worry, Winry.

939
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:05,450
I'll show you the underground
city as soon as we're finished here.

940
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:09,430
Huh.

941
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,030
I guess Elicia and
her mom came by.

942
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,400
So, why did you lead me
all the way here, Wrath?

943
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:29,920
Guess I'll find out soon enough.

944
01:02:37,390 --> 01:02:39,030
It's just like the one in Lior!

945
01:02:58,156 --> 01:02:59,736
I'm so hungry.

946
01:03:00,310 --> 01:03:03,030
I hope they have some of
those white sausages left.

947
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,710
No beer for you tonight, guys?

948
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:06,690
That's a first.

949
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,030
I think you better stay
indoors tonight, kid.

950
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:11,550
By morning, this nation
will be completely reborn.

951
01:03:11,950 --> 01:03:13,430
That's why we're
here celebrating.

952
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,350
Careful, Noah.

953
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:19,610
That guy's with Thule.

954
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:22,374
Hold on, Noah.

955
01:03:23,530 --> 01:03:24,010
Noah!

956
01:03:24,011 --> 01:03:27,290
What are you d-Listen, Hughes.

957
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,650
This is no time for a lecture.

958
01:03:28,651 --> 01:03:32,299
You may not realize it, but that man
there is-We're on the Eve of a war, Edward.

959
01:03:32,450 --> 01:03:34,990
That spineless regime in
Berlin will be overthrown.

960
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,490
And the Führer will lead
this nation to greatness.

961
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,750
Noah is helping us get there.

962
01:03:40,970 --> 01:03:42,190
Or didn't you realize?

963
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:46,450
Every man in here is a member of the
same group fighting for a stronger country.

964
01:03:46,730 --> 01:03:49,270
The National Socialist
Workers' Party.

965
01:03:56,126 --> 01:03:57,053
Let go of me!

966
01:04:00,143 --> 01:04:01,289
Come on, get in!

967
01:04:03,183 --> 01:04:03,803
Hey!

968
01:04:05,340 --> 01:04:08,160
You do want to go to
Haushofer's villa, correct?

969
01:04:08,401 --> 01:04:09,160
Yeah.

970
01:04:09,935 --> 01:04:11,335
Why are you helping me?

971
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:11,860
Who knows?

972
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:15,500
Maybe I'm just trying to avoid
being forced out of my dream.

973
01:04:25,870 --> 01:04:27,190
We're ready for test flights.

974
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:28,930
We'll just need some
kind of transport.

975
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:30,590
Sorry, Alphonse.

976
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,747
I thought I'd made it clear.

977
01:04:32,070 --> 01:04:34,490
We don't have to move
the rockets to test them.

978
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,525
You mean you're actually intending
to launch from inside this factory?

979
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:53,020
Noah?

980
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,040
Yes.

981
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:58,040
She's the Gypsy psychic we've
been looking for all this time.

982
01:04:58,620 --> 01:05:01,580
It's a blessing for us that you
kept her in Munich, Alphonse.

983
01:05:01,780 --> 01:05:02,640
Why is she here?

984
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:06,720
She's the key that will open
the great door... to Shamballa.

985
01:05:08,695 --> 01:05:11,595
I had no idea you
could create it so quickly.

986
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:15,680
You're sure that's what you saw... when
you were inside Edward Elbrick's mind?

987
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,200
So everything Ed knows
about Alchemy, you now know?

988
01:05:20,201 --> 01:05:20,820
Yes.

989
01:05:21,040 --> 01:05:21,380
Right.

990
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:23,580
The magic?

991
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:24,440
No.

992
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:26,360
The transmutation circle.

993
01:05:26,600 --> 01:05:27,660
Isn't that their phrase?

994
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:29,640
Is there some incantation?

995
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:30,740
No.

996
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,360
There were no
spells in his mind.

997
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:36,160
The alchemists must circulate energy
between themselves and the circle.

998
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:44,370
It seems we have a visitor knocking
on the other side of Shamballa's door.

999
01:05:46,525 --> 01:05:49,925
It's been a long time since we've
gone sneaking around like this.

1000
01:05:49,950 --> 01:05:51,550
Are you sure this
leads to the old

1001
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:52,550
Führer's office...

1002
01:05:58,620 --> 01:05:59,760
It failed.

1003
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,060
There's something missing.

1004
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:06,020
What is it?

1005
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,720
I did see the gate on that day.

1006
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:18,318
If this one works the same way, then
the equivalent exchange to make it open.

1007
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:18,600
..

1008
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,220
It has to be...

1009
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:44,170
Gluttony?

1010
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:45,490
Gluttony?

1011
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,490
He's one of the seven like me.

1012
01:06:47,650 --> 01:06:48,690
A monster!

1013
01:07:05,737 --> 01:07:09,910
Tonight, November 8th, in the Beer
Hall, where the able men of Bavaria gather.

1014
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:16,330
The leader of Germany's National Socialist Workers'
Party, our Führer Adolf Hitler, will stand before them.

1015
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,770
He will urge the
state militia to rise up.

1016
01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:22,810
From there, they will march on
Berlin and take control of the state.

1017
01:07:22,970 --> 01:07:26,230
We have to act now and
open the road to Shambhala.

1018
01:07:26,410 --> 01:07:29,570
We have to supply the Führer
with the arsenal that we promised.

1019
01:07:29,710 --> 01:07:31,479
We're not even sure if
we can survive the trip.

1020
01:07:31,630 --> 01:07:32,890
Then it's time to find out.

1021
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,990
Elric's knowledge
was not enough.

1022
01:07:35,310 --> 01:07:36,850
She can't open the door.

1023
01:07:38,823 --> 01:07:39,743
What was that?

1024
01:07:41,825 --> 01:07:43,445
Think you can fly this thing?

1025
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:44,290
More or less.

1026
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:58,660
I guess we don't have
to go pick him up now.

1027
01:08:00,579 --> 01:08:03,299
And here he is, dropped
from the heavens.

1028
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,580
Seems we can't
do this without you.

1029
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,040
You mean using Noah
as my stand-in didn't work?

1030
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,680
How could you?

1031
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,720
But it's your world on the other
side, isn't that right, Edward?

1032
01:08:13,575 --> 01:08:15,055
Well, it's not Shambhala.

1033
01:08:15,275 --> 01:08:16,675
I can promise you that.

1034
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:17,780
I want to see it!

1035
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:20,760
No, I want to go there
and never come back!

1036
01:08:21,540 --> 01:08:23,380
Isn't that the only place
where I can belong?

1037
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:25,300
Another world where
people won't hate

1038
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:26,609
and distrust me!

1039
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:29,695
I thought the Roma
were proud of their ways.

1040
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:33,660
Constant travelers who valued the
tribe and had no need for a homeland.

1041
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:35,220
But I want something more!

1042
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:37,260
I've always dreamt of it!

1043
01:08:37,480 --> 01:08:38,280
Trust me, Noah.

1044
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:42,360
What lies ahead for
us now... it's no dream.

1045
01:11:22,491 --> 01:11:23,050
Do it...

1046
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:26,230
You'll transmute us both.

1047
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:28,630
Then the gate will open...

1048
01:11:29,523 --> 01:11:32,523
...to take us back... Of course.

1049
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:37,590
The gate always opened up when
a Homunculus was brought to life.

1050
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:42,771
Those who came through the gate
can be material to open it, that's right.

1051
01:11:43,022 --> 01:11:45,202
That's right... That's
why I came with you.

1052
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:50,790
I know you're planning to offer your
own life as the price for saving your brother.

1053
01:11:51,970 --> 01:11:54,210
I don't ever want
to see that happen.

1054
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:55,583
Never again!

1055
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:56,730
But wait!

1056
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,783
You don't mean
you want to... Please.

1057
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:00,470
I just want to go home.

1058
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:02,590
Where mommy is.

1059
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:08,363
Now!!!

1060
01:12:51,286 --> 01:12:52,466
I wouldn't do that.

1061
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:00,341
Dad...

1062
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:02,308
How did he get here?

1063
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,373
What's going on?

1064
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,860
We found this was the most effective approach
for keeping the Great Serpent calm and quiet.

1065
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:11,800
Luckily for us, your
father doesn't die so easily.

1066
01:13:12,539 --> 01:13:13,039
Hey.

1067
01:13:13,293 --> 01:13:14,513
There you are.

1068
01:13:15,506 --> 01:13:16,486
About time.

1069
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,600
How, dad?

1070
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:18,960
How did they get you?

1071
01:13:19,220 --> 01:13:19,700
Easily.

1072
01:13:19,701 --> 01:13:22,300
I wanted to create a
portal between our worlds.

1073
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:26,020
By using the science and magic
they study on this side of the gate.

1074
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,640
Haushofer made me a proposal.

1075
01:13:29,060 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm getting you down!

1076
01:13:30,340 --> 01:13:30,840
Son, no!

1077
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,380
This is what I wanted.

1078
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:35,340
I'm a sinner, Ed.

1079
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,620
I failed to bring
my son back to life.

1080
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:41,280
Instead, I turned him into a
monster and abandoned him.

1081
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,700
I took the lives of countless
people to save myself.

1082
01:13:44,701 --> 01:13:47,140
And couldn't stop this
beast from hurting you.

1083
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:51,026
So what?

1084
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,180
How are those reasons
for helping them?

1085
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,840
You're trying to get me home.

1086
01:14:01,220 --> 01:14:05,240
I'll offer my life as the price, then
transmute envy to create the portal.

1087
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:06,280
Forget the portal!

1088
01:14:06,340 --> 01:14:07,480
I don't need to go back!

1089
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:09,680
Give Al my regards.

1090
01:14:39,993 --> 01:14:40,807
Why?!

1091
01:14:42,855 --> 01:14:43,995
Prepare the Rockets

1092
01:14:44,020 --> 01:14:45,340
We're going through!

1093
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:48,255
Really?

1094
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:49,780
You're the lucky one, Ed.

1095
01:14:54,884 --> 01:14:55,375
SHH.

1096
01:14:55,893 --> 01:14:57,073
What is this?

1097
01:14:57,220 --> 01:14:59,640
I've set everything up
so you can go back home.

1098
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,580
You can take this second
rocket while Eckhart isn't looking.

1099
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:03,380
You ready?

1100
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:12,506
Lieutenant, inform the
Führer of our situation.

1101
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,140
Professor, is the
portal stabilized now?

1102
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,180
Seems to be.

1103
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,780
But that's not the point.

1104
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,280
I don't believe it's Shamballa.

1105
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:20,640
I think that Ed's right.

1106
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:23,160
Yes, I realize that.

1107
01:15:28,010 --> 01:15:29,510
Right in the fake arm.

1108
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:31,330
Good thing she's a bad shot.

1109
01:15:32,485 --> 01:15:35,185
Our rockets peak at over
two kilometers a second.

1110
01:15:35,210 --> 01:15:38,610
Should be enough speed to punch
through the pressure and get out safe.

1111
01:15:39,690 --> 01:15:41,370
That's Haushofer's
theory, anyway.

1112
01:15:42,361 --> 01:15:44,441
This one-seater shouldn't
have any problem.

1113
01:15:44,466 --> 01:15:45,305
Wait a minute!

1114
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:47,090
I never said I wanted to go!

1115
01:15:47,750 --> 01:15:49,590
I'm not giving you a choice, Ed.

1116
01:15:51,442 --> 01:15:52,622
Because I'm in the way.

1117
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:54,330
You're trying to get rid of me.

1118
01:15:57,150 --> 01:15:58,290
We're real, Edward.

1119
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,110
We're not just part of your
dreams like you thought.

1120
01:16:02,110 --> 01:16:02,990
I care.

1121
01:16:03,923 --> 01:16:05,043
And I make mistakes.

1122
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:09,210
I may not live much
longer, but I'll still be here.

1123
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:14,693
Just don't forget me.

1124
01:16:19,528 --> 01:16:20,222
Alphonse!

1125
01:16:21,348 --> 01:16:22,455
Alphonse wait!!

1126
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,215
Alphonse!!!!!!

1127
01:16:24,402 --> 01:16:25,308
Damn it!

1128
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:28,843
What!

1129
01:16:56,384 --> 01:16:57,157
Edward!

1130
01:16:57,690 --> 01:16:58,770
I'm sorry.

1131
01:16:59,723 --> 01:17:01,763
Take me with you, Edward!

1132
01:17:02,596 --> 01:17:03,316
Please!

1133
01:17:07,502 --> 01:17:09,822
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!

1134
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,300
What is that?

1135
01:18:39,503 --> 01:18:40,643
Could it be?

1136
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:50,980
This power?

1137
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,701
The magic I've learned.

1138
01:18:54,726 --> 01:18:55,986
Now it's real.

1139
01:19:00,745 --> 01:19:01,855
Where are we?

1140
01:19:02,269 --> 01:19:03,669
I'm not really sure.

1141
01:19:03,694 --> 01:19:05,593
I'm just glad we're still alive.

1142
01:19:13,530 --> 01:19:15,930
So now do you
believe in space aliens?

1143
01:19:16,510 --> 01:19:17,770
Don't start that again.

1144
01:19:18,050 --> 01:19:18,410
Winry!

1145
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,090
Al.

1146
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:23,930
What are they?

1147
01:19:24,185 --> 01:19:25,125
I don't know.

1148
01:19:25,150 --> 01:19:27,270
All I did was open up the gate.

1149
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:27,690
What?

1150
01:19:29,030 --> 01:19:29,590
Huh?

1151
01:19:53,620 --> 01:19:55,400
landing still needs some work.

1152
01:19:55,680 --> 01:19:56,240
Edward.

1153
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,873
I was wondering when you'd show.

1154
01:20:03,819 --> 01:20:04,499
Winry.

1155
01:20:07,226 --> 01:20:08,105
Welcome home.

1156
01:20:09,833 --> 01:20:10,513
Thanks.

1157
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,180
Brother!

1158
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:16,020
Shaska.

1159
01:20:16,720 --> 01:20:17,400
Al.

1160
01:20:18,993 --> 01:20:20,686
I knew I'd see you again.

1161
01:20:21,132 --> 01:20:21,672
Yeah.

1162
01:20:26,416 --> 01:20:27,836
What is that, brother?

1163
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:30,090
It's a rocket-powered airship.

1164
01:20:30,170 --> 01:20:31,010
And it's armed.

1165
01:20:32,510 --> 01:20:34,125
They came to conquer this world.

1166
01:20:34,150 --> 01:20:37,270
And use any power they can
take from us to fuel their own war.

1167
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:40,090
It's my fault.

1168
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:42,470
So you're the one.

1169
01:20:43,157 --> 01:20:44,877
You made the gate on this side.

1170
01:20:46,765 --> 01:20:47,271
Al!

1171
01:20:55,426 --> 01:20:56,526
Same old Ed.

1172
01:20:57,795 --> 01:21:00,415
Home for five minutes and
you're off on another mission.

1173
01:21:00,440 --> 01:21:03,860
But you can't go into battle
with that arm and leg, can you?

1174
01:21:03,861 --> 01:21:04,540
Huh?

1175
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:08,060
You've been lugging those
around this whole time?

1176
01:21:09,540 --> 01:21:10,400
They're great.

1177
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,260
But I'm not so
sure they'll fit me.

1178
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,128
I've grown, you know.

1179
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,080
Who do you think
you're dealing with here?

1180
01:22:03,993 --> 01:22:05,393
Who are these bastards?

1181
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:07,440
Dammit!

1182
01:22:20,121 --> 01:22:22,600
Behold, my beautiful
artistic Alchemy!

1183
01:22:27,809 --> 01:22:28,222
Major!

1184
01:22:30,785 --> 01:22:31,785
Major Armstrong.

1185
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:32,430
Who are they?

1186
01:22:32,431 --> 01:22:34,310
They look like the same
ones that were in Lior.

1187
01:22:35,050 --> 01:22:36,570
But something's changed.

1188
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:39,930
Officers, look!

1189
01:22:40,070 --> 01:22:40,830
Behind you!

1190
01:23:04,602 --> 01:23:05,096
He's back.

1191
01:23:05,942 --> 01:23:07,736
Haha, welcomme
to the party General.

1192
01:23:08,100 --> 01:23:09,340
Warrant Officer Fallman.

1193
01:23:09,420 --> 01:23:11,340
Take a squad and
defend the assembly hall.

1194
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:12,240
Sir!

1195
01:23:12,340 --> 01:23:14,540
Sergeant Fury, inform
the mechanized division.

1196
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,480
We need a tank unit in Central.

1197
01:23:16,660 --> 01:23:16,980
Now!

1198
01:23:17,100 --> 01:23:18,080
Crush their ranks.

1199
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:18,400
Go!

1200
01:23:18,580 --> 01:23:19,060
Yes, sir!

1201
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,360
You know, he gives a lot of
orders for an enlisted man.

1202
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:22,720
Lieutenants Havok and Breda.

1203
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:23,780
Sir!

1204
01:23:23,900 --> 01:23:26,060
The command center's
our last stronghold.

1205
01:23:26,061 --> 01:23:30,480
Tell the generals to stop wasting time
and order all their divisions to come defend it.

1206
01:23:30,580 --> 01:23:30,900
Right!

1207
01:23:32,960 --> 01:23:33,840
Major Armstrong.

1208
01:23:35,640 --> 01:23:38,120
You know, if we're
gonna get to that aircraft...

1209
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,480
Then we'll need a way to fly.

1210
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:42,280
Got it.

1211
01:23:49,906 --> 01:23:51,566
We've been waiting for you, sir.

1212
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:55,630
Okay.

1213
01:23:55,631 --> 01:23:56,750
Try standing up.

1214
01:23:56,970 --> 01:24:00,150
You know, sometimes I think
you enjoy causing me pain.

1215
01:24:05,788 --> 01:24:06,735
Perfect!

1216
01:24:07,173 --> 01:24:10,985
Considering all the guesswork, I'd
say I did an okay job, don't you think?

1217
01:24:12,986 --> 01:24:14,462
More ships coming through.

1218
01:24:16,333 --> 01:24:17,233
Hide somewhere!

1219
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:39,720
It appears we've emerged
in the capital city of this land.

1220
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:42,220
Now I'll destroy it!

1221
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:49,920
More ships.

1222
01:25:01,670 --> 01:25:02,163
What!

1223
01:25:03,576 --> 01:25:04,636
Elric!

1224
01:25:05,092 --> 01:25:05,638
No!

1225
01:26:04,518 --> 01:26:05,138
Al!

1226
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:08,429
Hey.

1227
01:26:09,003 --> 01:26:11,243
I'm surprised you found
your way to the surface.

1228
01:26:11,970 --> 01:26:13,170
It was Wrath.

1229
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:15,723
He showed me all the
ways out beforehand.

1230
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:16,536
Wrath?

1231
01:26:17,690 --> 01:26:18,570
That's right.

1232
01:26:19,336 --> 01:26:22,396
I made that permanent
gate by transmuting him.

1233
01:26:24,286 --> 01:26:24,660
Al..

1234
01:26:40,603 --> 01:26:41,136
NO!

1235
01:26:43,744 --> 01:26:45,091
You can't bring
back the dead Al.

1236
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,720
trying just causes more pain.

1237
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:52,460
Brother...

1238
01:26:54,512 --> 01:26:57,432
Is all of this... my fault?

1239
01:26:58,019 --> 01:27:00,099
Why is it all turning
out this way?

1240
01:27:00,420 --> 01:27:03,720
I just... I wanted... I know.

1241
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,260
You were just trying to
bring me back home again, Al.

1242
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,940
For whatever reason,
Wrath wanted to help.

1243
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,660
That sacrifice was his choice.

1244
01:27:14,731 --> 01:27:16,775
The other Al wanted
to get me home, too.

1245
01:27:17,046 --> 01:27:18,966
I feel like he did
something meaningful.

1246
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,300
And Noah wanted
a place to belong.

1247
01:27:21,980 --> 01:27:25,060
We all had our excuses,
and they seemed right to us.

1248
01:27:25,280 --> 01:27:28,440
And no one thought it would
lead to suffering like this.

1249
01:27:33,293 --> 01:27:34,313
I know that.

1250
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,820
None of us were
looking to start a war.

1251
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:42,060
But still... a war is what we got,
and so all of us take the blame.

1252
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:43,973
Do you understand?

1253
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,740
That's why... we
have to make it right.

1254
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:51,540
And defend this world...
as long as we're alive.

1255
01:27:51,986 --> 01:27:55,466
We can't keep living like our
own dreams are all that matter.

1256
01:27:55,885 --> 01:27:56,445
Okay.

1257
01:28:11,606 --> 01:28:12,386
How's it coming?

1258
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:15,620
This is the best we could
manage, given what we had.

1259
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:16,960
It's good enough.

1260
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:30,735
Stop! What are you doing?!

1261
01:28:30,760 --> 01:28:31,660
Easy now.

1262
01:28:31,700 --> 01:28:32,392
Sorry, Lieutenant.

1263
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,100
Only room for one.

1264
01:28:34,593 --> 01:28:35,293
You liar!

1265
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:35,900
Come back!

1266
01:28:38,414 --> 01:28:39,454
Over there!

1267
01:28:40,007 --> 01:28:40,861
What is that?

1268
01:28:41,394 --> 01:28:42,567
It's Ed.

1269
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:47,467
All this time, you
haven't lost your touch.

1270
01:28:47,507 --> 01:28:49,027
Give me a little credit Al.

1271
01:29:00,232 --> 01:29:03,052
If you're gonna strike,
do it now, Fullmetal.

1272
01:29:03,860 --> 01:29:04,300
General!

1273
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:22,840
Way to bring your trouble
home with you, Fullmetal.

1274
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:23,520
Really nice.

1275
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:25,080
Smart remarks already.

1276
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:26,680
Nice patch, by the way.

1277
01:29:26,700 --> 01:29:28,396
Though it should have
covered your mouth, too.

1278
01:29:28,420 --> 01:29:29,080
Sorry, sir.

1279
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:29,780
Ignore it.

1280
01:29:46,365 --> 01:29:47,585
Now go, Fullmetal.

1281
01:29:47,610 --> 01:29:48,486
I'll guard the entrance.

1282
01:29:48,510 --> 01:29:49,350
That's why I came.

1283
01:29:49,351 --> 01:29:51,050
You don't have to tell me twice.

1284
01:29:51,305 --> 01:29:52,285
Hold on, brother.

1285
01:29:52,310 --> 01:29:52,830
Wait for me.

1286
01:29:55,763 --> 01:29:57,603
I always knew you were alive.

1287
01:30:04,923 --> 01:30:05,716
What's wrong?

1288
01:30:06,529 --> 01:30:08,689
Why is my magic being blocked?

1289
01:30:16,104 --> 01:30:18,370
This land is completely foreign.

1290
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:20,643
Not like my world at all.

1291
01:30:20,990 --> 01:30:22,770
You're wrong
about that, Eckhart.

1292
01:30:22,990 --> 01:30:27,550
People here laugh and weep, just
like you, live the same, die the same.

1293
01:30:35,910 --> 01:30:37,750
There's one thing
I want to know.

1294
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:39,770
What made you start this attack?

1295
01:30:40,390 --> 01:30:44,170
I thought the point was to use weapons
of this world to conquer your own.

1296
01:30:44,270 --> 01:30:46,130
So why would you wage war here?

1297
01:30:46,430 --> 01:30:47,090
I have to.

1298
01:30:47,905 --> 01:30:50,245
This entire world must perish.

1299
01:30:50,270 --> 01:30:51,110
But why?

1300
01:30:51,610 --> 01:30:52,890
Because I fear it.

1301
01:30:54,810 --> 01:30:57,470
Opening a door to a new
world was thrilling at first.

1302
01:30:57,790 --> 01:30:59,890
A utopia that could
make us greater.

1303
01:31:01,351 --> 01:31:03,824
But then I realized how
different it was from our own.

1304
01:31:04,704 --> 01:31:05,337
I got scared.

1305
01:31:06,224 --> 01:31:08,451
This world is far too
strong to be trusted.

1306
01:31:09,636 --> 01:31:12,142
I have to destroy it
now, before it conquer

1307
01:31:12,413 --> 01:31:15,747
That's ridiculous, this world doesn't
have any reason to conquer yours

1308
01:31:15,772 --> 01:31:16,839
How can you know that?

1309
01:31:16,893 --> 01:31:18,266
Because we're
humans just like you.

1310
01:31:18,313 --> 01:31:18,820
Liar!

1311
01:31:19,467 --> 01:31:22,441
You may wear the same skin
as us, but inside you're different.

1312
01:31:22,975 --> 01:31:24,149
You're monsters!

1313
01:31:24,415 --> 01:31:26,675
Now i understand
the person you are!

1314
01:31:45,530 --> 01:31:46,590
Let's end this.

1315
01:31:54,770 --> 01:31:56,190
It's human nature.

1316
01:31:57,976 --> 01:32:00,516
We can't accept what
we don't see in ourselves.

1317
01:32:01,830 --> 01:32:02,990
We fear it.

1318
01:32:03,350 --> 01:32:04,150
Reject it.

1319
01:32:04,783 --> 01:32:06,823
And that is the
beginning of war.

1320
01:32:07,396 --> 01:32:10,176
When I look at
you, I see a beast.

1321
01:32:10,590 --> 01:32:13,490
That is why I
can take your life.

1322
01:32:14,656 --> 01:32:15,596
Kill him!

1323
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:27,240
What?

1324
01:32:28,420 --> 01:32:30,380
Alchemy can give
us all sorts of abilities.

1325
01:32:30,660 --> 01:32:31,840
This is one of mine.

1326
01:32:35,879 --> 01:32:36,819
Don't touch me!

1327
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:38,340
What are you doing?

1328
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,560
Get away!

1329
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,973
Get away!!!!!

1330
01:32:56,359 --> 01:32:57,867
I get the feeling
that it's over.

1331
01:32:58,753 --> 01:32:59,313
Yeah.

1332
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:08,520
So what now?

1333
01:33:15,067 --> 01:33:15,489
Brother?

1334
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:16,635
Brother!

1335
01:33:16,660 --> 01:33:17,460
What are you doing?

1336
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:21,860
That should be enough Alchemic
material to get yourselves down.

1337
01:33:23,866 --> 01:33:24,746
What about you?

1338
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:26,367
Where will you go?

1339
01:33:27,240 --> 01:33:30,240
I'm gonna take what's left of
these soldiers back to their world.

1340
01:33:30,280 --> 01:33:30,460
Why?

1341
01:33:30,580 --> 01:33:31,880
You don't have to go with them!

1342
01:33:32,720 --> 01:33:34,620
I have to break the
gate on their side.

1343
01:33:35,373 --> 01:33:40,833
I need you to stay here and destroy it on this
side too, so the portal can never be opened again.

1344
01:33:41,146 --> 01:33:42,306
What about Wenry?

1345
01:33:42,940 --> 01:33:44,400
Don't you know
she misses you, too?

1346
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:47,120
Tell her thanks.

1347
01:33:47,780 --> 01:33:49,560
She always made the best of me.

1348
01:33:50,126 --> 01:33:50,646
Wait!

1349
01:33:50,900 --> 01:33:51,740
Brother, no!

1350
01:33:52,375 --> 01:33:53,895
I just got you back!

1351
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,140
You can't go again!

1352
01:34:00,340 --> 01:34:01,120
That's Ed.

1353
01:34:01,700 --> 01:34:02,660
I know it.

1354
01:34:06,420 --> 01:34:08,740
So, I guess it's
goodbye for good.

1355
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,220
The uprising failed!

1356
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:21,620
Munich Command
figured out our plan.

1357
01:34:21,979 --> 01:34:24,239
And with the help of the
police, they blocked our march.

1358
01:34:24,546 --> 01:34:28,486
The other demonstrators were beaten
back along the way, keeping us divided.

1359
01:34:28,872 --> 01:34:30,552
And did the Führer get away?

1360
01:34:33,179 --> 01:34:34,979
We really were too late.

1361
01:35:21,392 --> 01:35:22,385
Open it again.

1362
01:35:23,186 --> 01:35:24,086
The doorway!

1363
01:35:24,606 --> 01:35:25,686
Do it now!

1364
01:35:26,939 --> 01:35:28,799
I must destroy it.

1365
01:35:30,705 --> 01:35:33,318
Sham.........balla

1366
01:36:08,547 --> 01:36:09,161
Edward.

1367
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:10,780
Noah...

1368
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:12,780
That's right.

1369
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,040
After all that
trouble, I'm still here.

1370
01:36:15,500 --> 01:36:16,020
Surprised?

1371
01:36:21,549 --> 01:36:22,489
But why?

1372
01:36:22,883 --> 01:36:25,183
Why would you come
back to our world, Ed?

1373
01:36:29,780 --> 01:36:31,040
It's hard to explain.

1374
01:36:31,640 --> 01:36:33,340
He came to destroy the gate.

1375
01:36:35,620 --> 01:36:38,200
So you transferred
your soul again, huh, Al?

1376
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:41,240
How long till you
fade out this time?

1377
01:36:45,700 --> 01:36:46,140
Al!

1378
01:36:46,141 --> 01:36:47,400
What are you doing here?

1379
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:50,660
I jumped onto your ship
at the last minute, brother.

1380
01:36:51,707 --> 01:36:54,447
Then I hid inside this armor,
so you wouldn't find me.

1381
01:36:54,700 --> 01:36:57,820
General Mustang should be breaking
down the gate on the other side right now.

1382
01:36:58,399 --> 01:37:00,719
And we're going to
destroy it on this side, right?

1383
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,600
But you won't be
able to go home, Al.

1384
01:37:06,420 --> 01:37:08,200
I want to be at
your side, brother.

1385
01:37:08,360 --> 01:37:09,300
No matter what.

1386
01:37:09,600 --> 01:37:11,360
I want to see the same things.

1387
01:37:11,540 --> 01:37:12,700
And learn what you learn.

1388
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:14,440
And keep on journeying together.

1389
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,180
Like those years we
were looking for the stone.

1390
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:18,720
Despite all the hardships.

1391
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:21,040
Those were the
best times we had.

1392
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:25,120
Al, are you telling me
your memory's back?

1393
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:25,620
Mm-hmm.

1394
01:37:25,800 --> 01:37:27,720
When I left our
own world, I think.

1395
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:31,720
Equivalent exchange, huh?

1396
01:37:37,172 --> 01:37:40,072
Destroying that gate's gonna
be a challenge without Alchemy.

1397
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:43,669
Between the two of
us, we'll figure it out.

1398
01:37:56,779 --> 01:37:59,679
Motion pictures
and weapons of war.

1399
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,220
Science has created them both.

1400
01:38:03,140 --> 01:38:06,840
So while others point their
guns, I'll have my camera.

1401
01:38:07,080 --> 01:38:12,117
Offering fantastic dreams of
other worlds just beyond our reach.

1402
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:29,090
So, where are we
headed now, brother?

1403
01:39:29,280 --> 01:39:33,320
First we have to track down that uranium
bomb that was brought over from the other side.

1404
01:39:33,880 --> 01:39:37,520
A weapon like that shouldn't
exist, no matter which world it's in.

1405
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:43,720
People are saying another
great war is inevitable here.

1406
01:39:44,559 --> 01:39:48,179
And from everything that's
going on, maybe they're right.

1407
01:39:48,360 --> 01:39:50,980
Are you sure we should
get involved in their battles?

1408
01:39:51,387 --> 01:39:57,386
Like I said, Al, we can't keep thinking we're all
that matter, that the world has nothing to do with us.

1409
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,720
That goes for both
sides of the gate.

1410
01:40:00,173 --> 01:40:01,613
This is where we live.

1411
01:40:02,440 --> 01:40:03,460
It's home now.

1412
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:05,433
And we have to do our part.
