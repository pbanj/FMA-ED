1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,720
Nice of you to come.

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,360
Graciously, do I welcome you here.

3
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,840
You don't look too welcoming with that
sword.

4
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:30,940
I have been entrusted with guarding these
grounds.

5
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,060
For now, you may call me number Forty-eight.

6
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:35,316
Forty-eight?

7
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:35,956
Catchy.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,340
It's been silent for too long.

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:41,640
I'm pleased to face someone capable again.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,960
But your luck has run out running into me.

11
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,360
Do not think ill of me, child.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,260
And you don't think ill of me for being
the child who defeated you.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,460
How about a little blade on blade?

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,380
Nice.

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,460
You move well for a big thing.

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,776
Good.

17
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:05,536
Who are you?

18
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,980
Ooh, so demanding.

19
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,000
I guess I should answer.

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,940
I'm number Sixty-six.

21
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:13,940
Oh, that's just what they call me at work.

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,900
Number Sixty-six?

23
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:16,916
Yes.

24
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,516
I have a proper name, too.

25
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:21,560
But if I told you, you'd be so shocked
you'd wet yourself.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,560
I'll tell you when I'm peeling your skin.

27
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,340
Those reflexes!

28
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,840
Why, you!

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,440
Curious child.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,560
An anchoring seal.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,360
Bodyless armor.

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,320
He's just like Al.

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:09,740
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

34
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,260
To obtain, something of equal value must
be lost.

35
00:02:13,261 --> 00:02:16,900
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

36
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:24,360
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

37
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,230
Fascinating.

38
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:34,550
This deserves a better introduction.

39
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:38,730
Number Forty-eight was my
label as a condemned prisoner.

40
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,470
According to the official records,
I was executed two years ago.

41
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,106
Prisoner?

42
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,906
So that proves it.

43
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:50,930
There is a link between Laboratory 5 and
the prison next door.

44
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:55,706
When my body was flesh and blood,
the papers called me the Slicer.

45
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,690
I was a mass murderer and I made a real
splash.

46
00:04:58,691 --> 00:05:01,770
Here my skills have been put to a
different use.

47
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:03,610
I'm its immortal guard.

48
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,870
No, you're hardly immortal.

49
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,290
What?

50
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,130
That seal of blood.

51
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,110
It's alchemy.

52
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,690
Someone took the iron in that blood and
attuned it to the metal in your armor.

53
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,730
That's what keeps your soul bound to this
world.

54
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:26,570
If someone breaks the seal it's made,
then you're a dead man.

55
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,530
Ha ha ha!

56
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:30,890
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

57
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,090
Finally, someone with a backbone.

58
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,030
Someone who thinks they can live.

59
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,930
This should be a good fight.

60
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,350
I've told you I know your weakness.

61
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,750
This is your final warning before I use
it.

62
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,930
I don't care!

63
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,730
See, I'm the type of person who likes a
little struggle in the kill.

64
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,340
So try to make it last.

65
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,580
Aaaaah!

66
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,160
What was that?

67
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,860
My shoulder nearly caved.

68
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,096
A lighter weight should make you faster.

69
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:41,360
But that means it's easier to break too,
so don't be reckless.

70
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,896
I'm in trouble.

71
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,060
Better make this quick.

72
00:06:48,040 --> 00:07:00,360
[Fighting Sounds]

73
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:05,456
Just like a Monkey aren't you?

74
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,100
You better watch your mouth.

75
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:08,035
Ha ha ha ha!

76
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:11,680
It's been so long since I've had such
responsive prey.

77
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:16,140
But judging from your wound and your
breathing, it won't last much longer.

78
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,980
My body, unlike yours, does not know
fatigue.

79
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,040
Give up any hope you had.

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,320
As we speak, my colleague is disposing of
your companion outside.

81
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,140
You can't rely on him to help you now.

82
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:32,920
Heh.

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
So this colleague of yours, is he strong?

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,700
Yes, he is.

85
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,480
Though not as strong as myself.

86
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,060
What's so funny?

87
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,180
I've got nothing to worry about then.

88
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,356
My companion, as you put it.

89
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,960
I've fought him plenty of times,
and I've never beat him once.

90
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,040
Aaaaah!

91
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,480
Errrr. Quit that!

92
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,480
Hold still so I can cut you off!

93
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,340
Stop!

94
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,936
Miserable behemoth!

95
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,900
You're smiling at me, aren't you?

96
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,876
I'll spill your insides!

97
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,980
I'll show you how thinly you slice!

98
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,220
Now you're frightened!

99
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,180
I'll carve out his shoulder, Rose!

100
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,526
Now you've gone and done it, you brute!

101
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:40,550
You've knocked off my head!

102
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,430
You're empty inside.

103
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:49,106
Yes, that's what they said when they
sentenced me.

104
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,250
And thanks to the circumstances,
it ended up quite literal.

105
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:54,690
You don't recognize me like this,
do you?

106
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,330
What do you mean?

107
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:57,810
Don't tell me you forgot!

108
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,150
After all, it was thanks to your help
catching me that I ended up here.

109
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,610
A condemned man.

110
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,210
Number Sixty-six was my name on death row.

111
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:10,070
But back when I was flesh and in trails,
I had better names.

112
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,850
Barry the Butcher.

113
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:14,890
Or my favorite, Barry the Chopper.

114
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,390
Barry the Chopper?

115
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,630
You're the one who kidnapped Winry.

116
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,206
That's right.

117
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,290
And after being caught, imprisoned,
and executed, I've come back from a pit of

118
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:30,990
fire to take my revenge on you,
maggot!

119
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,210
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

120
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:33,650
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

121
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,810
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

122
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:36,951
Is that so?

123
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,250
Is that so?

124
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:39,766
What do you mean, is that so?

125
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:42,575
People get terrified when a
serial killer comes back from

126
00:09:42,576 --> 00:09:45,206
the dead, and an empty suit
of armor moves on its own.

127
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,830
You should be saying, Ah!

128
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:48,130
Or, Ah!

129
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,070
What's wrong with your body?

130
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:51,726
Ah!

131
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,450
What's wrong with your body?

132
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,606
Take it easy.

133
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,510
You're going to hurt my feelings.

134
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,486
Hmm.

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,350
Are you an executed prisoner, too?

136
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,286
No, I'm not a crook.

137
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,426
I suppose not, no.

138
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,306
Why would you have been helping the
police?

139
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,790
But who cares where you came from?

140
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,710
I know your weakness now!

141
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,590
You'd better beg for mercy.

142
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,170
Your life belongs to me.

143
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:14,010
If I destroy the blood seal on your armor,
you'll die!

144
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,730
The same goes for you, right?

145
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,566
Ah!

146
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,050
But I still have the advantage,
you rotten beast!

147
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,210
You don't know where my blood seal is.

148
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,446
And you don't know where my seal is,
either.

149
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:24,610
Ah!

150
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,546
Then I'll just have to chop you up until I
find it!

151
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,566
And you can't do that because you don't
have a knife!

152
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,546
Ah!

153
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,710
Why do I have to get the crazy one?

154
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,806
B and C block
both turned up zilch.

155
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:37,866
He's not a magician.

156
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:38,946
We know he's here somewhere.

157
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:41,026
I want him found, whatever it takes!

158
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,190
Yes, sir!

159
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:45,046
He has guts, that's for sure.

160
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,750
Attacking a military facility in the
middle of Central.

161
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,546
I still don't understand, Major.

162
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,626
Why is Scar so preoccupied with Edward
Elric?

163
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,110
What's he trying to get from him?

164
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:54,450
That's not your concern.

165
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,690
Where are the Elrics now?

166
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:59,306
Uh... The Elrics, right, sir?

167
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:00,470
I don't know.

168
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,750
Uh...

169
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,066
You're acting suspicious, bloch!

170
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,066
I'm sorry, sir!

171
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,746
I'm sorry!

172
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:06,970
You see, they...

173
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,530
Permission to speak, Major, sir?

174
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:10,226
Hmm?

175
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,830
With your authorization, I'd like to
relocate any troops we have available.

176
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,470
What are you talking about?

177
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,646
Helping out the Elric brothers,
Major.

178
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:19,110
I know their current location.

179
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,810
The Central Laboratory, number five.

180
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:21,626
Hmm.

181
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,770
And what else can you tell me?

182
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,700
You're on a downward spiral.

183
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,676
Your moves keep getting sloppier.

184
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,920
Admit it, little man.

185
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,936
You're through.

186
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,376
Who are you calling so little you can't see?

187
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,620
Too small a target to hit without a
magnifying glass?

188
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,360
Ha ha ha ha. At least you still
have enough energy to scream.

189
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,300
But that, too, will pass.

190
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,880
Not the auto-mail again.

191
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,540
Oh!

192
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,340
Oh!

193
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,481
Oh!

194
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,600
Why don't I...

195
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,770
You give me far too little credit.

196
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:45,870
Did you really think you could beat me
with the toss of a spear?

197
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:47,070
Please.

198
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:49,710
Thank you for the struggle.

199
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,750
You've done well to last this long.

200
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,810
But your limit's been reached.

201
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:01,066
Relax.

202
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,410
Admit your defeat.

203
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,030
There's nothing you can do to win now.

204
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,930
We'll see about that.

205
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,746
You're forgetting a key detail.

206
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:11,970
I didn't come here alone.

207
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:14,426
Now, Al!

208
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,590
Attack!

209
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,886
Huh?

210
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:17,726
Sorry.

211
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,410
I didn't hear you come in.

212
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:22,930
What?

213
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:25,090
Whoa!

214
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,270
Ah!

215
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,930
No fear.

216
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,120
I'll spare no more.

217
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:40,280
Everyone knows that.

218
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,280
Why are you stopping now, boy?

219
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,820
My blood seal isn't broken yet.

220
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,116
Your soul's attached to your helmet.

221
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,480
Now that it's cut off, your body's just a
useless hunk of iron.

222
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,260
You're no threat to me anymore.

223
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,080
Now down to business.

224
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,100
There's something you need to tell me
about.

225
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,620
The Philosopher's Stone?

226
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:15,800
If you came here, there's little else you
could be seeking.

227
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,396
Good, then let's cut to the chase.

228
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:21,460
Tell me all you know about the stone and
its connection to this lab.

229
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,696
I can't do that.

230
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,816
Really?

231
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,756
Listen, Slicer.

232
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,880
Beating up dogs don't get to call the
shots.

233
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,880
You tell me now or I'll break your seal.

234
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:32,380
The battle isn't over yet.

235
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,420
Ahh!

236
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,180
Ow.

237
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,640
It can't be.

238
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,200
Haven't you heard of sharing?

239
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:53,840
One set of armor doesn't have to mean one
soul.

240
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,240
A second blood seal.

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,940
This one on the body.

242
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,680
Are you okay, older brother?

243
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,040
Yes, younger brother.

244
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,280
Just barely.

245
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:07,720
And your brothers?

246
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,040
Did I forget to mention that?

247
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,300
Yes, you forgot.

248
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,236
That's what made the mass murderer and the
slicers so great.

249
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,580
He was a pair of mass murdering brothers.

250
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,076
All this time I've actually been fighting
two people.

251
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,920
That sure reeks of foul play.

252
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,580
All's fair in war.

253
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,240
Isn't that what he said?

254
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,960
Yes, brother, it is.

255
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,980
How dare you injure my older brother.

256
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,460
I'll slice you off at the knees so you're
even closer to the ground.

257
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,960
More short jokes, huh?

258
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,736
You'll pay for that.

259
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,120
Just like him.

260
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,560
Oh no, I'm not giving you time for
alchemy.

261
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,720
I'm getting lightheaded.

262
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,820
I'm losing too much blood.

263
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,100
End of the line.

264
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm really gonna die here, aren't I?

265
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,680
No, dammit, I can't.

266
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:18,980
I can't die here.

267
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:22,761
If it ends like this.

268
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,960
And who's gonna finish the job and get Al
back to normal again?

269
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,160
This is for my brother.

270
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,120
And this is for mine.

271
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,380
You don't have time to transmute.

272
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,880
To beat a serial killer, I guess I'll have
to act like one.

273
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,390
A partial transmutation.

274
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:02,530
He stopped at step two, breaking something
apart.

275
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,450
Sorry about that.

276
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:14,726
But I don't have time to die.

277
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:15,890
I've got work to do.

278
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:19,146
Curse you!

279
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,630
Now you've done it, tinny.

280
00:17:20,631 --> 00:17:21,771
Oh, shut up and rust!

281
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,970
The slicer deserves better than this.

282
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,566
You'll pay, alchemist.

283
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:26,990
We'll tear you apart.

284
00:17:26,991 --> 00:17:29,370
Won't we, older brother?

285
00:17:29,610 --> 00:17:31,130
No, younger brother.

286
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:34,110
It pains me to say it, but we've lost.

287
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,270
There wouldn't happen to be a third
brother, would there?

288
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,450
Both: No.

289
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,730
You can pat yourself on the back,
child.

290
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,050
This time, you really won.

291
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:45,866
Perfect.

292
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,230
Then this time you can tell me everything
you know about the Philosopher's Stone.

293
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,550
No, I cannot say.

294
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,026
Listen to me.

295
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,206
You must destroy us.

296
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,066
You heard him.

297
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:56,966
Finish the job.

298
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:59,070
There's nothing for the defeated but
death.

299
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,310
That's our rule.

300
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:03,790
I'm not killing anyone.

301
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,270
That's not what I do.

302
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:06,470
Hmph.

303
00:18:06,471 --> 00:18:08,946
You're too generous with your words.

304
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,046
Saying anyone, not anything.

305
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:14,730
As if we could still be called human in
this twisted state.

306
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,826
I didn't say kill us.

307
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,990
I said destroy.

308
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:20,450
Destroy these things we've become.

309
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,230
Now get on with it.

310
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,580
The only way I could do that is if I
admitted your definition was right.

311
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:35,759
And if I did, if I accepted you
weren't human, that means

312
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:39,120
I'd have to admit the same of
my brother and I can't do that.

313
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,400
He's your brother.

314
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,580
Damn it!

315
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,180
I hate you!

316
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,540
Can we call it a draw already?

317
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,120
I'm worried about my brother.

318
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,300
Brother?

319
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,441
You're kidding.

320
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,360
That little pipsqueak alchemist is your
brother?

321
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,216
Yes.

322
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,416
And he gets angry if you call him that.

323
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:09,936
I see.

324
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,200
This changes everything.
[Laughs]

325
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,836
What?

326
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,260
How?

327
00:19:15,261 --> 00:19:19,020
So then it was your brother who put you in
that armored shell.

328
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,056
Isn't that right?

329
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:20,856
Yes, he did.

330
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,440
He risked his life to do it.

331
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,536
To save me.

332
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,480
Oh, that's just rich.
[Laughing]

333
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:28,240
What are you laughing about?

334
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:28,976
Nothing.

335
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,596
Nothing.

336
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,416
I'm sorry.

337
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,600
It's just, brotherly love is so beautiful.

338
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,460
Gets me every time.

339
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,520
Even when it's a total fraud.

340
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,000
A fraud?

341
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,180
That's right.

342
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,580
Artificial affection.

343
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,256
No.

344
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,996
You're wrong.

345
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,240
You don't know anything about it.

346
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,336
My brother loves me for real.

347
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,376
And I love him.

348
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,460
What a naive worm you are.

349
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,616
What if you're a fake?

350
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,636
An imitation?

351
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,160
How would you know the difference?

352
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,476
Your brother's the one who crafted you in
this form.

353
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,096
How do you know you don't love him because
he made it so you would?

354
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,920
Tailored your memories and personality to
suit him best.

355
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,180
That just isn't true.

356
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,436
I'm Alphonse Elric.

357
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,980
I'm exactly the same as I was when I was a
boy.

358
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,220
I know I am!

359
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,416
But that's the trick, isn't it?

360
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,660
Your so-called soul.

361
00:20:14,661 --> 00:20:15,801
It's invisible.

362
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,280
Undetectable by any scientific tool.

363
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,120
But what if you were designed in a way to
make it impossible for you to decipher

364
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:25,656
what's real and what lies your brother has
been feeding you?

365
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,176
No.

366
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,400
That can't be.

367
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,076
My brother's a person.

368
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,116
I'm telling you.

369
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,980
And that means you guys are too.

370
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,360
I don't want to kill you.

371
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,880
I can't.

372
00:20:39,504 --> 00:20:41,504
Ha ha ha ha

373
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,528
Ha ha ha ha!

374
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,520
Are you all right, older brother?

375
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,516
Yes.

376
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,060
It's funny, that's all.
Ha ha.

377
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,280
As long as I remember, my brother and I
thrived off stealing, carnage, and murder.

378
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:58,880
We were demonized, spit on, called
animals.

379
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,560
Forget biology.

380
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,780
We were inhuman because they couldn't
stomach what we did.

381
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,520
And now's the first time we're treated as
people with when we're scraps of metal.

382
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,660
It's too much.

383
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,960
What a stupid irony.

384
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:15,096
I'm a person.

385
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,056
I'm real.

386
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,580
I'm Alphonse Elric.

387
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,340
How can you prove this Alphonse ever
existed?

388
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,980
That the identity isn't a lie of
convenience?

389
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,436
Where's your body?

390
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:25,576
Have you seen it?

391
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,040
He said it was gone.

392
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,280
For the whole thing to be a fabrication?

393
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,476
Mom?

394
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,396
Everything?

395
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,660
It couldn't be.

396
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,720
There's this thing, see.

397
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,260
It's something I've been meaning to tell
you for a long time now.

398
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,780
But I've been kind of scared, I guess,
of what your reaction is.

399
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,800
What was he trying to tell me?

400
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,420
What was he scared of?

401
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,720
Am I not what I think I am?

402
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,480
Brother?

403
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:40,595
Full Metal Alchemist.

404
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:42,719
Episode 21: The Red Glow.

405
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,880
If there's one single color that can
describe a human life, that must be it.
