1
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,600
One book in this whole mess.

2
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,940
It's like searching for a
needle in a stack of needles.

3
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,080
She can't be.

4
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:31,850
Someone there.

5
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:36,766
So you're him?

6
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:38,650
What are you here
for, scarred man?

7
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,850
You look like her, but
that couldn't be possible.

8
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,290
What smell is that?

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,030
It's like an Ishbalan with tasty
blood taped all over his hands.

10
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,850
Let me guess.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:55,226
You've come here to take care of
the full metal pipsqueak, haven't you?

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,590
But we can't have that.

13
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,506
We have our own
special needs, after all.

14
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,750
He has to keep searching
for the Philosopher's Stone.

15
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,810
You're using the boy?

16
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,146
Silly me.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,130
Now I think I've said too much.

18
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,990
OOOO Lust Does that
mean I get to eat him, too?

19
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:21,956
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,700
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,160
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

22
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:36,620
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

23
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,820
Central!

24
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:20,340
It's good to be back.

25
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,140
But why are we standing around
when the library's waiting for us?

26
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,780
Brother, wait for me!

27
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,516
Come on.

28
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,836
What's the big rush, boys?

29
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,940
It's not as if the
library's going anywhere.

30
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,700
After all this searching,
we've got our first solid lead.

31
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,540
I can't just sit on my butt now.

32
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,440
Major Armstrong, sir, we've been
sent to meet you here as you requested.

33
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,820
Well done, troops.

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,560
I need to go directly to HQ
and get back to my other duties.

35
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,700
From now on, these
two will be guarding you.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,876
Introduce yourselves.

37
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,816
Lieutenant Maria
Ross reporting, sir.

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,036
And I'm Sergeant Denny
Bloch, humbly at your service.

39
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:55,096
It is an honor to meet you, Full
Metal Alchemist Edward Elric, sir.

40
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,716
Wow!

41
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,556
You certainly live
up to your name, sir.

42
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,656
When they say Full Metal,
they really aren't kidding.

43
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,320
Uh, you're talking
to the wrong guy.

44
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,176
I'm used to it by now.

45
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,336
Huh?

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,836
Really?

47
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,000
You mean this little guy?

48
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,696
Uh, sorry, sorry, sir.

49
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,280
It's just, I thought you'd be
fuller and more... more metal.

50
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,060
Uh, shut up!

51
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,496
Come on, Major.

52
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,976
We don't need
babysitters anymore.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,380
We've both been fully repaired.

54
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,256
Sorry, Edward.

55
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,540
I'd avoid it if I could.

56
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,536
We've informed the Major that Scar
has been spotted around Central again,

57
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,700
and he's specifically
targeted you in the past.

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,160
We have no other choice, Edward.

59
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,100
You'll just have to
put up with it for now.

60
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,396
But you don't need to
worry, Full Metal Alchemist.

61
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,400
We'll keep you and your
brother safe from harm.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,260
I just hope you
don't slow me down.

63
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,056
Wait!

64
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,760
We have a car waiting for you!

65
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,640
Sorry about my brother.

66
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,820
He's like that with everyone.

67
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,140
Don't take it personally.

68
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,041
The boy may not look like much, but he's
come through for us on many occasions.

69
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,696
So make sure he
finds what he came for.

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,860
Sir, I'll try.

71
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,860
But I'm afraid it's
too late for that now.

72
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,020
As fate would have it, the library's
first branch burned down just last night.

73
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,780
You gotta be kidding.

74
00:05:10,781 --> 00:05:13,395
Scar's unwanted posters
all over town, and several

75
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,480
eyewitnesses saw him in the
area just before the fire started.

76
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,120
Brother.

77
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,200
Our only decent
lead is a pile of ashes.

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,416
And I'm not just saying this
because I'm her father, Roy.

79
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,580
Everyone agrees!

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,580
Seriously, you have to hear the girl,
and to think she's only three years old!

81
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,440
She has the voice of an angel.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,500
That settles it.

83
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,620
She's gonna be an opera star.

84
00:05:39,621 --> 00:05:42,880
Lieutenant Colonel, some
of us have real work to do.

85
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,716
Yeah, I've got loads of it.

86
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,560
I never know where
the hours in the day go.

87
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,955
So, Hughes, you think
there's a way to use alchemy to

88
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:52,580
send fire through a phone
line, torch someone's ear off?

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,476
I'm not sure, Flame Alchemist.

90
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,116
Great question.

91
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,280
I'll get my people on it.

92
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,980
There is another reason
that I called you, though, Roy.

93
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:04,080
Based on eyewitness accounts, we're
now certain that Scar was involved in the fire.

94
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,980
But from the looks of things,
I don't think he acted alone.

95
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,380
There's signs of a struggle
that got way out of hand.

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,780
And Scar?

97
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,940
Any sign of what
happened to him?

98
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,740
There's evidence of the
fight dragging into the sewers.

99
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:19,380
His blood-stained clothes
washed up further downstream.

100
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,940
We don't know if that means
he's dead or just naked.

101
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,040
On another note, ever since the death of Brigadier
General Grand, the rumor mill's been going crazy.

102
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,076
People are saying that you're going
to be transferred back to Central soon.

103
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,590
Of course, there are some
factions here putting forth the

104
00:06:32,591 --> 00:06:35,076
ridiculous notion that you're the
one who's behind these rumors.

105
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,240
Can you believe that?

106
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,160
That is ridiculous.

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,940
Still, a homecoming in Central.

108
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,620
It sounds nice.

109
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,400
Be careful, Roy.

110
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,080
You've got some enemies
around here in very high places.

111
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,860
I'm ready any time.

112
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,500
My advice to you is to make as
many friends as you can around here.

113
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,840
Friends who will support
you when the time comes.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,500
Which is why I make
this crucial suggestion.

115
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,656
You find yourself a wife.

116
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,556
Give it a rest!

117
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,596
Please, Colonel, don't
take it out on the phone.

118
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,276
Come on, sir!

119
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,236
Get off the desk!

120
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,400
Heh heh.

121
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,660
We've been
searching all morning.

122
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,440
I'm sorry, but these are the
only books that we've recovered.

123
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,860
Out of the whole First Branch?

124
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,880
We'll be okay.

125
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:23,040
I'm sorry, officers, but I'm not seeing any
books by Tim Marcoh in the main building.

126
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,940
If they'd been moved here from the
First Branch, there'd be a record of it.

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:27,896
Wait a sec.

128
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,756
Isn't it possible that somebody
has it checked out right now?

129
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,716
I suppose.

130
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:34,620
But the circulation records
were destroyed in the fire.

131
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,816
Gotcha.

132
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,180
I guess we're never
gonna find that book.

133
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:43,456
If only we could confirm Dr. Marcoh's
book was even in there last night.

134
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,396
That would be a start.

135
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,540
Was anyone else working with
you at the library who might know?

136
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,240
No. Gerald and I were the only two
librarians on staff at the First Branch.

137
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,580
Just two of you?

138
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:56,340
Being restricted to state alchemists,
we didn't get too much traffic.

139
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,716
Last time I was there, I remember
a mousy girl with glasses on.

140
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,556
Oh, I know.

141
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,080
You're talking about Sheska.

142
00:08:04,081 --> 00:08:06,916
But you must not have been
there lately because she was let go.

143
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,476
Let go?

144
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,616
She was an odd duck.

145
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,180
Never really fit in around here.

146
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,956
Yes, she always had
her nose in a book.

147
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,120
Really?

148
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,490
Guess she's not home.

149
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,110
The lights are on inside.

150
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,466
I'm going in.

151
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,630
You can't do that!

152
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,670
It's nothing but books in there!

153
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,810
I can't believe somebody
actually lives in that.

154
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,626
Excuse me, Ms. Sheska.

155
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,790
You home?

156
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,690
Sheska!

157
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,750
I don't think she's here.

158
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,210
Help me!

159
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,450
Please!

160
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,526
Somebody!

161
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,730
Please help!

162
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,470
She's in here somewhere!

163
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:49,950
I know!

164
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,110
Just keep digging!

165
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,546
Thank you all so much.

166
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,146
Really.

167
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,866
They always said I'd probably
die with my head in a book.

168
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,030
I just never thought
they meant it literally.

169
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,666
Sheska, you used to work
in the library's First Branch.

170
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:11,270
Isn't that right?

171
00:09:11,471 --> 00:09:12,511
That's right.

172
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:15,970
Unfortunately, they fired me for what
they called lackluster performance,

173
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:16,506
i.e.

174
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,150
reading instead
of doing my work.

175
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,690
I needed that job.

176
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,586
My mom's sick and
I've got to pay her bills.

177
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,890
But being surrounded by all those
books, I couldn't control myself.

178
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,106
Sorry to hear that.

179
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,386
Let me just cut to the chase.

180
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:31,346
Do you happen to remember ever seeing a book
written by Tim Marcoh while you were working there?

181
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,286
It's really important.

182
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,486
By a Tim Marcoh?

183
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,906
Yeah.

184
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:37,210
It would probably have been a
thick, handwritten research journal.

185
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,750
Let me see here.

186
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,650
Thick, handwritten
research journal.

187
00:09:40,651 --> 00:09:42,350
Tim Marcoh.

188
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,996
Yeah, I remember now.

189
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:51,340
It was a leather-bound volume with lots of
handwritten pages, very thorough, plenty of detail.

190
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,916
And you're sure about that?

191
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,080
Yeah, I remember all the books,
especially the ones in the back.

192
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,060
In the back?

193
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,760
Then it was in there and
we'll never get to read it.

194
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,880
Brother.

195
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,600
Sorry about that, guys.

196
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,240
I know how upsetting it can be when you
can't find that one book you're looking for.

197
00:10:11,241 --> 00:10:14,020
It's a tragic story I'm
all too familiar with.

198
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,940
I, myself, once scaled the heights and
plunged the depths of the highest mountain

199
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:23,900
of books for three days, but still didn't
find the elusive tome I'd been searching for.

200
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,600
It's so tragic.

201
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,020
So very tragic.

202
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,536
Don't do that, Sheska.

203
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,396
You helped us out.

204
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,396
Thanks to you, we at least know
that the book really existed in there.

205
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,696
And now I think I know
what my next move is.

206
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,036
What?

207
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,040
You mean it's not
totally a lost cause?

208
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,916
I'm going to transmute the ashes
of these books to their original forms.

209
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,936
That would be incredible.

210
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,640
You can really do
something like that?

211
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,040
Watch and learn.

212
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,910
Wow, strong wind.

213
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:58,410
Is that what I was
supposed to be watching for?

214
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:01,650
I guess we're just
not meant to read it.

215
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:08,750
Actually, if you want, I can
reproduce the book for you no problem.

216
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:13,490
I've got a photographic memory, you see,
so I can recreate any book I've ever read.

217
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:18,286
And since I did read that book while I was
working there in the library... You can do that?

218
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,490
Then why in the world
didn't you say so earlier?

219
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,746
Well, because people have
always made fun of me for it.

220
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,150
But if I can be of some help...

221
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,970
Alrighty, it's all here.

222
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:31,123
As you can see, it's a
pretty long book, so it took

223
00:11:31,124 --> 00:11:33,571
me three whole days to
get it all down on paper.

224
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,430
And this... this entire
pile is Marcoh's research?

225
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,946
Are you sure?

226
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,526
Yep.

227
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:42,006
Detailed step-by-step
instructions for everything

228
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:44,210
from appetizing appetizers
to delectable desserts.

229
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:47,890
It's Tim Marcoh's 1,000 Recipes
for Making Magic in the Kitchen!

230
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:58,036
One tablespoon of sugar,
a pinch of salt, a dash

231
00:11:58,037 --> 00:12:01,451
of pepper... nothing too
magical about this recipe.

232
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,430
You think maybe you
got the wrong author?

233
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:05,406
Not a chance!

234
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:08,250
I reproduced verbatim what
Dr. Marcoh wrote in those journals.

235
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,466
It was all for naught.

236
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:10,526
Sorry, Fullmetal.

237
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:11,526
I don't know.

238
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:11,590
Huh?

239
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:15,416
So, Sheska, you're positive every
word's precisely as it was in Dr.

240
00:12:15,417 --> 00:12:16,406
Marcoh's version?

241
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,186
Oh, yes, sir!

242
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,350
No doubt about it!

243
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,870
Sheska, you really
are an amazing talent.

244
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:24,450
Lieutenant, make sure
she's properly compensated.

245
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,946
You'll see a figure there.

246
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,971
Go to the State Alchemist's Treasury and have
them take that amount out of my research budget.

247
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,146
Al, come on.

248
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,310
I'm right behind you.

249
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:36,010
But I'm security!

250
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,670
Take care of this Bloch.

251
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,830
I don't get it.

252
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,766
What the heck is he going
to do with the cookbook?

253
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,930
Bake a cake?

254
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:49,754
That's a lot of money.

255
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,371
If he can authorize that kind of expenditure,
he really must have some reputation.

256
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:57,506
Sir, wait up!

257
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,970
Where are you going to now?

258
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,390
We're going to hold up in the
Central Library's main building for now.

259
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,410
After all, they've got the best
resources for this sort of work.

260
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:06,090
No way.

261
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:09,346
A library was Scar's last
mark, and he's still at large.

262
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,570
It's impossible for us to protect
you in that kind of public venue.

263
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,830
Figuring out a way to do your job
right is your problem, Lieutenant Ross.

264
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,770
Getting the Philosopher's
Stone is mine.

265
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,350
Please try to understand.

266
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,870
We finally got a lead.

267
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,360
So these are Marcoh's notes.

268
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,400
On the surface, they appear
to be an ordinary cookbook.

269
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,120
You really think the secret
to the stone is in here?

270
00:13:39,121 --> 00:13:40,616
It does make sense.

271
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,480
Marcoh didn't want just anyone
to read it, so he wrote it in code.

272
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,920
As for the cookbook disguise,
you know what they say.

273
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,400
Alchemy was born in the kitchen.

274
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,576
So now all we have to do is
crack the secret language of his.

275
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,740
No sweat.

276
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,940
Damn, so much for that
whole no sweat business.

277
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,596
Get a marker,
make a few columns.

278
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,560
I thought it'd be easy.

279
00:14:32,561 --> 00:14:35,680
It'd be a whole lot faster if
we could just ask Marcoh.

280
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,876
We're trying to keep the
military out of the loop here, Al.

281
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,980
And Marcoh's in the
Fuhrer's custody now.

282
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,356
Wakey, wakey.

283
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,040
So how you doing there, boys?

284
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,336
Lieutenant Colonel!

285
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,116
What's the matter?

286
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,780
Been too busy to come say hello?

287
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,580
It's these damn
scar spottings lately.

288
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,060
God is chasing our own tails.

289
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,720
So Al, did you get the full
body repair you needed?

290
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,516
Yes, sir.

291
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:56,496
Good as new.

292
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,260
They sure are chummy with the
Lieutenant Colonel, don't you think?

293
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,260
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes.

294
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,918
If there were to be an
attack here, we could not

295
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,056
ensure the safety of these
two as we've been ordered.

296
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,120
They should return to
the command center now.

297
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:11,040
I told you, Ross,
don't get in my way.

298
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,456
Lieutenant Colonel, as
long as Scar remains at large,

299
00:15:13,457 --> 00:15:15,860
security of State Alchemists
must be a top priority.

300
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,616
Sorry, Ed, but I'm afraid
Lieutenant Ross does have a point.

301
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,780
Don't say that.

302
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,340
But, then again, this
really isn't my jurisdiction.

303
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,500
Why don't you take it
up with Major Armstrong?

304
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,000
No, please, anybody
but Armstrong.

305
00:15:27,001 --> 00:15:28,421
We really don't have to do that.

306
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,540
Lieutenant Colonel,
we're close to it now

307
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,256
I can feel it.

308
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,336
I'm begging.

309
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,096
Hmm.

310
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,576
What I'd like to do is give
you extra protection, Ed.

311
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,060
But between hunting down Scar and
scrambling to replace the case files that

312
00:15:41,061 --> 00:15:44,500
were destroyed in the fire, my men
are all completely tied up right now.

313
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,656
All your case files?

314
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,616
You mean they were
stored in the first branch, too?

315
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,636
Yeah.

316
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,440
Affidavit, suspect list,
crime scene logs, all of it.

317
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,480
You're in luck.

318
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,260
Meee!

319
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:57,301
Really?

320
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,440
Um, I know I wasn't supposed to
look through those military records,

321
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,016
but I ran out of books to
read while I was working there.

322
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,476
Well, that's what
we wanted to hear.

323
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,316
If she can actually do what you say she can,
Ed, that would certainly be a big help for us.

324
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,836
She can do it
all right, trust me.

325
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,796
So what do you say?

326
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,960
Does she have the job?

327
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,000
Honestly?

328
00:16:14,001 --> 00:16:18,180
You mean a weirdo like me whose only skill is
reading might be able to work for the military?

329
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,600
Don't sell yourself short.

330
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,440
The world needs people who really
care about something and work hard at it.

331
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,520
You have a gift, Sheska.

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,416
You should own it.

333
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,640
Be proud of yourself.

334
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,340
Thanks, Al.

335
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,420
All right, I'll take the
job if you want me to.

336
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,260
Thank you for
your consideration.

337
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,760
Sure, you're hired.

338
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,896
And now that that's all
settled, let's get right to work.

339
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,120
And you should know,
I pay better than Ed.

340
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,600
Thank you so much.

341
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,456
I guess you win again, Ed.

342
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,901
Now I can free up a couple of additional soldiers
to cover the security in the library for you.

343
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,336
Wow, thanks, pal.

344
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,580
I wasn't even thinking about
that as a possible outcome.

345
00:17:00,581 --> 00:17:01,721
Right.

346
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,270
Night, everyone.

347
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:06,770
Don't work yourselves too hard.

348
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:11,010
Just a minute,
Lieutenant Colonel.

349
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:17,166
Lieutenant Ross, I know full well
what you're going to say to me now.

350
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,409
But I know those boys too,
and they'll do whatever they

351
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:21,851
want regardless of whether
we give them permission or not.

352
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,650
All that we can do is protect
them as best as we can.

353
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,590
I expect your cooperation.

354
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:29,830
I can't agree with you just
giving them a blank ticket.

355
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:32,230
Encouraging them to continue
despite all of the dangers.

356
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:34,670
With all due respect,
sir, they're only children.

357
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,730
There's more going on
here than you understand.

358
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,530
Those two children in there have the
ability to find something that no one else can.

359
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:45,330
This state's future is in their hands,
and as adults, it's our job to enable them.

360
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,850
When you have kids,
you'll understand.

361
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,060
Brother!

362
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,380
I see.

363
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,260
You're homunculi.

364
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:02,980
Clever.

365
00:19:02,981 --> 00:19:07,861
I didn't know there were still humans who
knew that word, let alone believe that we exist.

366
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,770
So sad.

367
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,610
I didn't get to eat him.

368
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:30,466
Yes, a pity.

369
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,186
I would have liked to have
verified Marcoh's research journal.

370
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:35,330
But I guess it makes
no difference now.

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,440
Oh, you're awake.

372
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,420
Really wasn't expecting that.

373
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,680
I thought we were going
to have to bury you for sure.

374
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,880
Where am I?

375
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:00,580
Hey, it's true that you're
an Ishbalan, isn't it?

376
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,000
Don't worry, it's not bad.

377
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,140
Everybody else
around this colony is too.

378
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,540
Grandpa! He's up!

379
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:15,681
He's not dead!

380
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:20,400
Oh, you must be quite the stubborn
mule to have come back from that one.

381
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,940
Well, you're the
one, aren't you?

382
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
The one on all
their wanted posters.

383
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,300
You can relax, warrior.

384
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:31,080
There's none among us who
would sell out one of our own people.

385
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:36,280
I had no idea there were this many
Ishbalans alive after the massacre.

386
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,520
It's not just here, my son.

387
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,916
There are settlements like this
scattered all across the country.

388
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,720
Our people are thriving.

389
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:49,580
Oh, sons of Ishbala, the entirety of the
world is the bosom of the Lord our God.

390
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:03,770
They still haven't found
what they're looking for, huh?

391
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,737
I haven't the foggiest clue
what they're doing in there,

392
00:21:06,738 --> 00:21:09,270
but I wish they'd give it a
rest so we could go home.

393
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:10,046
It won't happen.

394
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,910
Look, they won't give up until
they get what they came for.

395
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,670
And we just give them
invisible security until they do.

396
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,330
Damn it!

397
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,090
I get it now.

398
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,886
Why they all call this
quest the Devil's Errand.

399
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:29,246
Why they either quit their
research or are driven insane by it.

400
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:30,106
Easy.

401
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,550
The secret, Al.

402
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,070
The last ingredient
of the stone.

403
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:36,170
It's live human beings.

404
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,690
Hey, what's the matter?

405
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:43,670
Just when I thought...

406
00:21:45,270 --> 00:21:49,070
Just when I thought it was
finally within our grasp...

407
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,370
You're leaving?

408
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,290
Thank you for all your help.

409
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,530
You know, you could stay.

410
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,190
I do not belong here.

411
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:02,170
Regardless of my intentions, I've done
too many things to betray God's law.

412
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:09,710
That tattoo... it's incredible.

413
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,310
Yes.

414
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,560
It was a gift my brother gave
to me, so I couldn't forget.

415
