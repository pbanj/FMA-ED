1
00:00:14,063 --> 00:00:15,500
Will you drop this
stupid routine?

2
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,280
I've told you
everything we know!

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,820
Sorry, sir.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,240
The orders from Lieutenant
Colonel Archer were very clear.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,992
This isn't a time for protocol!

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,740
They've got my brother, dammit!

7
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,840
The Crimson Alchemist, Zolf J.

8
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,760
Kimbley, and the Sewing
Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,900
A pair of infamous ghosts.

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,980
I've held my end of the bargain.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:43,960
How about you?

12
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,740
You don't have to worry.

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,420
Neither do you, Doctor.

14
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,460
I'll guarantee
safety for you both.

15
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,040
See, you're under the
protection of Frank Archer now.

16
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:54,740
Protection?

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,060
That's right.

18
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:59,060
I'm reinstating you into the
military to continue research.

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:02,400
But this time, you'll be
working directly under me.

20
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,960
You'll let me finish my work?

21
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:05,960
Yes.

22
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,720
I'll be changing my orders.

23
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,040
Tell the troops not
to take prisoners.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,080
Kill anyone who
looks suspicious.

25
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,936
I want this place cleaned.

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,300
But, sir, they're civilians.

27
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:17,662
Are you sure that's okay?

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,640
It is now.

29
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,460
Now that Tucker's on our side, those creatures
can be replaced and not even Greed can stop me.

30
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,820
As long as I have this.

31
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,440
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

32
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:40,120
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

33
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,580
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

34
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:50,740
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

35
00:03:41,538 --> 00:03:42,258
Be smart.

36
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:43,064
Like hell!

37
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:47,977
Greed, move!

38
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:49,461
Right.

39
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:06,702
My name is Alex Louis
Armstrong. Air to the family trade.

40
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,080
But you can call me
the Strongarm Alchemist.

41
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:12,740
Major!

42
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,680
My demands are simple.

43
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,044
You give Alphonse Elric to me.

44
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,820
Sloth is quite the slave driver.

45
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,400
Ruthless to the bone.

46
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,160
Oh well.

47
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,440
It is her fault that Greed
slipped away in the first place.

48
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,080
Guess she has no choice.

49
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,340
Okay.

50
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,920
It's your move, Greed.

51
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,720
What next?

52
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,180
Damn!

53
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:52,740
Behold!

54
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,640
A little sample of the artistic alchemy that's been
passed down the Armstrong line for generations.

55
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,160
Well, obviously I'll need more
than this to stand a chance.

56
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,640
Maybe some real muscle instead.

57
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,930
I'm not sure what to say.

58
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:07,030
It's been too long since
I've had this good of a battle.

59
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,470
I'd expect nothing less
from you, Armstrong.

60
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,906
Your strength hasn't
changed at all from back then.

61
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,710
I served as a soldier on assignment
in Ishbal during the campaign.

62
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,370
I know your talents well.

63
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,770
A former comrade?

64
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,070
Well then I certainly
don't want to kill you.

65
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,770
Surrender now and live.

66
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,790
An impossible request.

67
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,420
It's us, Major.

68
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,140
Step aside.

69
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,420
We'll take him.

70
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Come on now, don't
waste your lives.

71
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,500
All right.

72
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll gladly take that advice.

73
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:46,140
But pass a message to
Kimbley and Tucker, will you?

74
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,140
Tell them both they've
just wasted theirs.

75
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,820
They finally quieted down.

76
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,980
He was being a real
noisy pain in the ass earlier.

77
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,620
Yeah, well I guess he
finally got tired of whining.

78
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,540
That's better for us.

79
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,260
You can say that again.

80
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,680
So we're the only
ones who got away.

81
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:52,170
What the hell am I gonna do now?

82
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,050
How long did you
think you could last?

83
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,710
It's been a thrill,
but time's up.

84
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,290
And who might you be?

85
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,710
From what I've been told,
you've already met Gluttony.

86
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,650
As for me... well, can't
you tell I'm the new Lust?

87
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,690
You don't say.

88
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,410
I don't usually like to be so quick about
things, but you have two options, Greed.

89
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:22,750
You can either be sealed
again... or you can die right here.

90
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,950
Who's gonna pull that one off?

91
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,330
Don't tell me it's you.

92
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,830
Here's a story.

93
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:32,710
A lowly Homunculus actually tries to
defy the person who pulls all the strings...

94
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,610
and is locked in a
cell for 140 years.

95
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:40,010
When he escapes,
that person gets angry...

96
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,470
and gives us everything
we need... to end it.

97
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:44,570
End it!

98
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,390
End it!

99
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,170
There's no time to talk, kid.

100
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,250
Just cooperate.

101
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,950
Make sure Marta's safe.

102
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,570
But what are you guys gonna do?

103
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:58,670
Wait, Law!

104
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,690
Dorochet, what's happening?

105
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,390
Get out of here, Greed.

106
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:02,890
Now.

107
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:04,710
We'll take care of this.

108
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,010
It's my problem.

109
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,370
Well, it's ours now.

110
00:09:08,371 --> 00:09:10,370
We're not going
to lose you here.

111
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,130
Just see that we're all avenged.

112
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:16,810
That's all I'm asking for.

113
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:20,830
My, you sure have some
loyal pawns, don't you?

114
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:24,110
You can blame it on the
Alchemists who engineered me.

115
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:25,770
I was combined with a dog.

116
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,350
Loyalty just runs in the blood.

117
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:28,970
Greed gave us hope for nothing.

118
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,470
Now we'll return the deed.

119
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,310
Greed, now!

120
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,270
Come on!

121
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:38,230
Okay.

122
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,950
And what did they
combine you with?

123
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:44,210
You may run for it if
you wish, Dorochet.

124
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:45,430
You know that.

125
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,690
Sure I could.

126
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,770
And I'd get away, too.

127
00:09:48,070 --> 00:09:50,670
But after all that talking,
I'd sure look like a fool.

128
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,852
Then you're at peace with this?

129
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,990
You're asking me now?

130
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,530
Hold on.

131
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,310
That's right over Dante's house.

132
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:13,790
Just us now.

133
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:15,930
You're such a good
little hostage, Alphonse.

134
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,070
You could have
just fled, you know.

135
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,330
I've been a little distracted.

136
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,010
That's not what I'm
worried about now.

137
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,250
Yeah, right.

138
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,990
Hey, listen, Marta.

139
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,390
Yeah?

140
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,710
Stay in this can till morning.

141
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,890
If I'm not back by then,
you're on your own.

142
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,499
Just make sure
you have some fun.

143
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:33,410
Okay?

144
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,570
Greed, what are you gonna do?

145
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,450
Can't get into it, doll.

146
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:38,850
The talking's done.

147
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:40,030
Wait!

148
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:40,830
Let me out, kid!

149
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:41,190
No!

150
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:42,299
I gotta go with him!

151
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:44,790
Stop!

152
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:47,290
He told me to stay in
this thing where it's safe!

153
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,090
I don't care!

154
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:58,900
After all of this time, I'm back
at the beginning of the tale.

155
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,620
Not even sure
what I came here for.

156
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,040
Maybe I'm gonna
beg that hag for my life.

157
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,080
Maybe not.

158
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,970
That's a good boy, Greed.

159
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,350
It all happened
exactly as we were told.

160
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,670
Are we done?

161
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,590
Yes.

162
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,170
I'd say we performed perfectly.

163
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:27,130
I'm still hungry!

164
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:41,090
Where's the old lady?

165
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:43,810
The reason you
came here is simple.

166
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,810
Because these are the grounds
that witnessed your creation.

167
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,090
Smart girl.

168
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,950
Those are... Your bones, yes.

169
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:18,250
Hey, where the hell
did you get those?

170
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,270
And what did Dante tell you?

171
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:22,610
Lady Dante is over there.

172
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:28,890
What's going on here?

173
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,770
Who are you?

174
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,990
How could you know?

175
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,750
How could you make that array?

176
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:43,410
You're just a damn kid.

177
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,590
Could it be...

178
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
That's alchemy.

179
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:12,717
My life...

180
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,230
That's my life!

181
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,700
You...

182
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,640
Dammit.

183
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:45,920
I found you, Greed.

184
00:13:54,685 --> 00:13:55,805
What the hell?

185
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,280
Explain this, Greed.

186
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,260
What happened here?

187
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,360
Beats me.

188
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,560
I was going to
ask you that, kid.

189
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,300
You did this to her, didn't you?

190
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,980
Are you gonna answer me?

191
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,860
Blame me if you want.

192
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,140
I really don't care.

193
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,500
How could you?

194
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,300
She was helpless.

195
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Tell me, Edward Elric, how could you
go so far to protect your little brother?

196
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,920
And what does that
have to do with anything?

197
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,740
Feelings can be hard to explain.

198
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,620
What are you talking about?

199
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,540
What have you done with Al?

200
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,560
If you want him back, come on.

201
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,720
You know what it takes.

202
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,100
Let me go! I need a help!

203
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,500
No!

204
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,820
You still don't understand
what you're dealing with, do you?

205
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,480
Didn't you say that I was a mistake
that you were going to correct?

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,700
This is the last
time I'll say it.

207
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:18,100
If you really want to stop
me... I'd best be ready to kill.

208
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,460
I know.

209
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,780
And you think you're
ready for that, kid?

210
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Remind me to thank
my mechanic, would you?

211
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,340
Even though it's busted to
hell, it still functions just fine.

212
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,280
Let's go!

213
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,380
Your alchemy's worth nothing
when you're fighting me!

214
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:52,230
Now it's my turn for fun.

215
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:08,790
What.

216
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,280
What the hell is this?

217
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,060
What have you done to
my shield, you little bastard?

218
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,780
It's easy when you
realize one thing.

219
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,140
There are no
unexplainable events.

220
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,100
Everything results from scientifically
measurable actions, even your precious shield.

221
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:29,710
It's been said that Homunculi have the same
body structure as Humans, on an elemental level.

222
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,660
And there's a key element in humans that serves to
increase the body's hardness and resistance to abrasion.

223
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:37,160
Carbon.

224
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,916
It makes up a third
of every person.

225
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:44,940
And carbon's degree of hardness can be
changed depending on the strength of its atomic bond.

226
00:16:44,941 --> 00:16:48,820
It can mean the difference
between a diamond and pencil lead.

227
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:53,620
Now that I know how to use
it, this shouldn't be too tough.

228
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,360
Now take me to Al.

229
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,760
Why would I do
that if I haven't lost?

230
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,680
Don't delude yourself.

231
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,700
This is over.

232
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm sure your
brother could tell you.

233
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,000
I don't die so easily.

234
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,380
Well, then I'll just have
to keep beating you down.

235
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:21,020
Till you wish you did.

236
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,400
What a relief.

237
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,460
I was worried this
wouldn't be fun.

238
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,520
I feel better for
gambling so much on you.

239
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,540
Let's start.

240
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,740
Let's finish!

241
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,680
Damn kid, that was good.

242
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
What about Al?

243
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
Where is he?

244
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,560
He's back in the woods.

245
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,380
I let him go.

246
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,620
But I thought...

247
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:35,900
We Homunculi were born when
an Alchemist tries to recreate life.

248
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:44,100
We are weakened when we're close to the remains
of whomever it was the Alchemist tried to resurrect.

249
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
That's the
Homunculi's weak point.

250
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,300
That's how we can
be killed, understand?

251
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,880
And not come back.

252
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,800
But why?

253
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,580
Why are you telling me this?

254
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,340
So you can beat them, Ed.

255
00:18:58,330 --> 00:19:00,540
They sealed me for so long.

256
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,900
You can't let them
stay in control.

257
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,600
But they're... like you.

258
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm greedy as hell.

259
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,700
Only out for myself.

260
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,040
She always said it
would be the death of me.

261
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,180
Greed!

262
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,680
They pull the strings.

263
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,600
Now cut them.

264
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,220
I'm counting... on you, kid.

265
00:19:37,955 --> 00:19:38,855
Hey now...

266
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,500
Greed, cut it out.

267
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,520
This is a joke, right?

268
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,460
Stop!

269
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,240
Hey!

270
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:46,920
I thought nothing
could kill you!

271
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,480
You're the Ultimate Shield!

272
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:49,900
You're indestructible, right?

273
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,900
I can't kill you!

274
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,078
Something's happened.

275
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,830
Marta, don't!

276
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,380
What did she tell you?

277
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,540
Nothing.

278
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,280
It was over when I got there.

279
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,960
Lyra's gone too.

280
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,200
I don't know where she went.

281
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,450
I'm not sure what
to say, teacher.

282
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,150
Except I'm sorry for all this.

283
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,490
We'll look for the
Ishbalans now.

284
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:25,370
If we stayed here, we'd
only bring more trouble.

285
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,657
There's a chance the military will come
looking for you, after all that's happened.

286
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,950
You should stay
hidden for a while.

287
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,050
Spare me, Ed.

288
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,090
If you guys start worrying about
me, it really is the end of the world.

289
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,618
Your goal is still
the same, then?

290
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:41,670
Yes.

291
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:45,360
We've gone through way too much
not to make it worth something now.

292
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:48,550
We'll keep on moving
until we get our bodies back.

293
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,590
We'll meet again.

294
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,350
I hope.

295
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,800
You wish?

296
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,740
Let's just talk over-the-top.

297
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Like tomorrow, we'll
meet up in this city again.

298
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,040
Yes.

299
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,136
Fullmetal Alchemist

300
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,960
Episode 35,
Reunion of the Fallen.

301
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,960
Where did we come
from, and where will we go?

302
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,280
Maybe those are just
questions for fools.
