1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,195
You're not going to
believe who's here!

2
00:00:10,265 --> 00:00:13,025
Ed, do you know this guy?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,645
Yeah, and that means...

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,185
And just where do you
think you're going, Ed?

5
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:29,285
You've always
been so predictable.

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,225
Hello, teacher.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,885
What are you doing here?

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,446
That's your teacher?

9
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,645
But that means she's...

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,156
An Alchemist.

11
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,785
Taught us everything we know.

12
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:42,225
Where is Alphonse?

13
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,245
Ma'am!

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,116
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:48,165
Well, I want to thank you so
much for escorting us here.

16
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,325
Do you know where
I can find Alphonse?

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,225
Um, well...

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,865
I'm Alphonse.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,596
That's right.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,556
Of course you are.

21
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,105
Now, as I was saying...

22
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,155
So you're hiding
in disguises now?

23
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:11,295
Don't worry.

24
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,455
I've had plenty of stories reach me about
my idiot apprentices breaking away from

25
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,174
everything I taught them to
become the scum of the military.

26
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:19,395
Isn't that right?

27
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:23,986
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

28
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,795
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:31,295
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

30
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:37,735
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

31
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,836
The official transfer
just came through.

32
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:21,865
Looks like you'll be working
in Central starting next week.

33
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,925
That's right.

34
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,018
Things won't be the
same without you.

35
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,125
You've been quite
colorful, to say the least.

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,576
Oh, I don't know.

37
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,116
I'm nothing compared to when
you were younger, General.

38
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:32,965
And Check.

39
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,585
Not too bad, huh?

40
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,796
I haven't had to do much
with you covering everything.

41
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,945
Now I might have to
start working again.

42
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,045
You have my deepest sympathy.

43
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,525
Checkmate.

44
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,325
You finally beat me.

45
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,985
Consider your win a
farewell gift, Colonel.

46
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,725
With honor, sir.

47
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,425
General.

48
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:56,965
Hm?

49
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,505
I have a request.

50
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:03,385
There are a few subordinates I'd
like to transfer with me to Central.

51
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,225
Sure, that's fine.

52
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,825
And take this, too.

53
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,725
Thank you, General.

54
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,905
You sure you're
gonna be all right, guys?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,536
Yeah.

56
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,525
We just didn't expect
her to come looking for us.

57
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,656
Damn it.

58
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,296
She took my watch.

59
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:26,165
And I can't exactly say
I'm comfortable like this.

60
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,285
It looks like we're headed
directly for Dublith, too.

61
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,825
I'm kind of surprised.

62
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:35,985
For some reason, I always figured your alchemy
teacher would be some old crone, but she's a beautiful lady.

63
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,465
How are you surprised?

64
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,436
You met her years ago, Winry.

65
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,325
We first became her students in
Risembool, back when we were boys.

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,785
I don't remember that.

67
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,616
Sure you do.

68
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,705
It was that day it
wouldn't stop raining.

69
00:04:50,570 --> 00:05:00,280
ECW 26%, ICW 34%, lipids 19%,
and protein... uh... This is dumb.

70
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,325
Maybe we'll learn faster if we
start with human composition.

71
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,560
Why are you guys
studying so hard all the time?

72
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,505
What are you up to?

73
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,765
Can't tell.

74
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:10,885
It's none of your
business, Winry.

75
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,125
No fair!

76
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,305
You guys are always
hiding stuff from me!

77
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,345
See ya!

78
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,445
Hey!

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,016
We're having stew tonight!

80
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,825
Don't be late!

81
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,785
Okay!

82
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,696
Great, Winry!

83
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,485
See you then!

84
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,685
Whoever invented
stew was a genius.

85
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,505
I mean, it's got milk in
it, but it still tastes good.

86
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,345
What are you talking about?

87
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:34,185
You know I hate milk, and normally you wouldn't
put it in vegetable soup, but with stew it works great.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,825
It's like being a
good scientist.

89
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,785
You have to think
outside the box sometimes.

90
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,095
You know, we do
have limits, brother.

91
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:50,695
There's no way we can learn
this whole thing on our own.

92
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,715
I know.

93
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,866
The missing step
in human alchemy.

94
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:56,275
What do you think it is?

95
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,735
I have no idea.

96
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,315
My question is why it's
forbidden in the first place.

97
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,255
I guess because it's so dangerous,
and no one's ever been able to do it right.

98
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:07,535
Remember that country
they say died in a single night?

99
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:10,930
You mean the story of the
Philosopher's Stone in the Eastern Desert?

100
00:06:10,931 --> 00:06:12,035
Yeah.

101
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:16,906
Someone tried to make a complete human,
and the whole population got dragged into it.

102
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:18,875
That's just a fairy tale, Al.

103
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,395
Huh?

104
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:23,495
These are his formulas.

105
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:30,335
If we could learn how
to make sense of them...

106
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:36,795
But even if we could understand, transmutations
that deal with humans are still forbidden.

107
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,455
We've already decided, Al.

108
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,635
We're bringing Mom back.

109
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,155
No matter what.

110
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,775
I just hope they can keep
the river barricades intact.

111
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,525
Boys, stop!

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,885
We're gonna go help!

113
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:10,009
Come on.

114
00:07:10,033 --> 00:07:11,033
Give me a hand.

115
00:07:11,057 --> 00:07:12,057
I need more bags.

116
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:13,581
It's too much.

117
00:07:13,805 --> 00:07:14,705
Over there!

118
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:16,529
Over here!

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,885
This is bad.

120
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,225
Hey, bring some more
sandbags over here!

121
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,356
Move it!

122
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,105
Move it!

123
00:07:25,025 --> 00:07:25,725
Come on.

124
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,815
Here goes.

125
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,175
We did it!

126
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,255
The circle washed away!

127
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,435
So now what?

128
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:44,955
Who's that?

129
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,911
Stand back.

130
00:07:46,935 --> 00:07:48,195
This could get a bit messy.

131
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,126
Look, lady.

132
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,175
We can handle this.

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,335
It's dangerous.

134
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:51,786
Leave!

135
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,755
Or stay.

136
00:08:06,985 --> 00:08:07,785
No way.

137
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,615
She didn't use a
transmutation circle.

138
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,515
And she moved all
that earth all at once!

139
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:16,446
There.

140
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,775
That should hold for a while.

141
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,746
I can't believe it.

142
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,355
Who in the world are you?

143
00:08:23,045 --> 00:08:24,615
Oh, just a couple passing by.

144
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,795
Where's your hospital?

145
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,335
Somebody get a doctor!

146
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,506
It's all right, lady.

147
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:31,295
Just hold on.

148
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,740
We can't thank you enough
for what you did back there.

149
00:08:37,741 --> 00:08:39,936
The whole town of
Risembool is in your debt.

150
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,885
Coming through.

151
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,116
Clear a path, guys.

152
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,125
Excuse us.

153
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,165
Hey there, old lady.

154
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,545
Some friendly advice.

155
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,805
Don't call me old.

156
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,305
We're sorry, ma'am.

157
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,925
We want to be your apprentices.

158
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,905
If you'll take us.

159
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,025
Apprentices?

160
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,445
We can already do a little
alchemy, but we need to know more.

161
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,436
We want to be the best there is.

162
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,525
With your help.

163
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,256
No.

164
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,726
But why not?

165
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,965
I'm not looking to
take on any students.

166
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,025
And besides, I've
got a store to run.

167
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,480
I need to get back to Dublith.

168
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,396
Please take us with you!

169
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,485
Make us apprentices!

170
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,905
Oh, shut up already!

171
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,976
What are you trying to accomplish
by learning alchemy anyway?

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,005
Just tell me that!

173
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,085
Well, um...

174
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:29,585
We want to help others out.

175
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,525
Do you have your
parents' permission?

176
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,265
Well, we...

177
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,665
I'm afraid they have no parents.

178
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:42,185
I've been looking after them
since their mother passed on.

179
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,785
It always happens.

180
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,465
I'm just too nice.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,107
I'll give them one month.

182
00:10:05,925 --> 00:10:08,025
Do you mind if I take
them with me for that long?

183
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,600
I'll test them to see if they're even
worth teaching alchemy to in the first place.

184
00:10:11,701 --> 00:10:14,205
See if they have
the right talents.

185
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,736
And what happens if
you find out they don't?

186
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,665
Then I'll send them
back right away.

187
00:10:19,825 --> 00:10:21,245
But what if we pass?

188
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,725
What'll happen then?

189
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:28,015
Then we'll begin
your alchemy training.

190
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,245
You guys realize we're not
coming back in a month, don't you?

191
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,125
I knew you'd say that.

192
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,640
Training!

193
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,345
Training!

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,091
Training!

195
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:42,480
Training!

196
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,305
I bet you there's a
gigantic laboratory.

197
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,665
You think we'll get
to read a lot of books?

198
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,465
Of course.

199
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:50,316
How else are we
going to learn anything?

200
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,165
Oh, yeah.

201
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,068
Teacher, you did your alchemy at the river
without a transmutation circle, didn't you?

202
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,256
How did you pull that off?

203
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,685
Are you a State Alchemist?

204
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
State Alchemists are thugs who take an innocent
life without blinking if someone gave the order.

205
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,165
Oh, yeah.

206
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,265
So you stayed with her.

207
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,445
There.

208
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,525
Got it.

209
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,265
Much better.

210
00:11:25,215 --> 00:11:26,225
Let's move out, Al.

211
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:30,725
Brother!

212
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,265
All that work and you still haven't
learned a thing, have you, boys?

213
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,385
Check.

214
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,296
Hey, wait a minute.

215
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,550
That's the rule.
- Are you sure?

216
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,256
So what's the story
with that game?

217
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,205
It's a form of chess they got
from the eastern island countries.

218
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,945
Hello?

219
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,325
Yeah, he's here.

220
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,325
Hey, that was a real fun time we
had the other night, don't you think?

221
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:00,960
I was hoping this weekend
we could have an encore.

222
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,425
Please, let me get that for you.

223
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,016
Havoc here.

224
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,876
Let's make this quick.

225
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,585
I'm working on some
important business.

226
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,416
That's it.

227
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,365
It's all fixed.

228
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,285
Thank you, sir.

229
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,625
Huh?

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,825
Hello?

231
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,775
Please, sir.

232
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,586
Add me to the list.

233
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:33,615
I'll do a good job.

234
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,966
When you were with Investigations,
you worked under Hughes, right?

235
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,295
Come in.

236
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,240
Master Sergeant Kain Fuery, Second
Lieutenant Heymans Breda, Second Lieutenant

237
00:12:56,241 --> 00:13:01,545
Jean Havoc, First Lieutenant Riza
Hawkeye, and Warrant Officer Vato Falman.

238
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,836
You five will be transferring
to Central with me.

239
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,825
If you have objections,
get over them.

240
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,625
That is all.

241
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,845
So much for our escape plan.

242
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,725
I know.

243
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:20,645
I've got chills just thinking about
what she's gonna do to us now.

244
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,405
Yeah.

245
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,185
Teacher!

246
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,956
Hey there, Menny.

247
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,145
So how's Chiko doing?

248
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,025
She's gonna have babies soon.

249
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,925
Goodness, your house
is gonna be crowded.

250
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,065
Izumi!

251
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,905
Welcome back!

252
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,036
Hey there, Mason.

253
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,316
That you, Edward?

254
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,825
Haven't seen you in a while.

255
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,736
So you've finally grown
a little bit, haven't you?

256
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,405
He loves to piss me off.

257
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,025
So, uh, who's your
big armored sidekick?

258
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,505
It's me, Mason.

259
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,345
His little brother, Alphonse.

260
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:55,603
That's one heck
of a growth spurt.

261
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,735
Are you going to eat, Ed?

262
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,755
Uh, ehh, No, thanks.

263
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,086
Eat it now, Ed.

264
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:06,995
Yes, ma'am.

265
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,146
Same goes for you, Al.

266
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,095
It's really tasty.

267
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,486
No, that's okay.

268
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,355
I'm full.

269
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:19,406
Wow, it sounds like you two have
been on one brutal journey since you left.

270
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,615
You shouldn't be getting
into so much trouble.

271
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,735
Well, it hasn't been all bad.

272
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,106
We've helped out several
people along the way.

273
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:26,755
Seriously.

274
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:30,455
We even helped deliver a
lady's baby a few years ago.

275
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,666
Please, you call that helping?

276
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,010
We just ran around screaming our
heads off, thinking she was gonna die.

277
00:14:36,011 --> 00:14:37,566
I guess so.

278
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,575
But the point is,
we did our best.

279
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,515
It was like that old proverb.

280
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:44,075
When a mother gives
birth, she risks her life.

281
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,295
And when the baby is born,
everyone around her is blessed.

282
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,386
Yes, that's true.

283
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:51,426
I'm sure it was the same way
when your mother gave birth to you.

284
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:54,215
You boys should be
thankful for the lives you have.

285
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,706
And what about you, Izumi?

286
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,235
Do you have a child of your own?

287
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,745
I'm sorry.

288
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,245
I was just, uh...

289
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,096
You've improved your
alchemy, right, Ed?

290
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,816
Can you show me?

291
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,356
Sure.

292
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,305
If you want.

293
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:11,925
Let's go.

294
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,416
Right.

295
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,145
I'll go, too.

296
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,785
Izumi.

297
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,505
I'm okay.

298
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,256
They've witnessed another
life come into this world.

299
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,125
That's an invaluable
experience for anyone to have.

300
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:27,965
All right.

301
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:28,805
I'll start.

302
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,565
Hey!

303
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,645
You have gotten better.

304
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,025
Okay, my turn.

305
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,765
Welcome back, teacher.

306
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,065
Yeah, welcome home.

307
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:44,656
My train broke while
we were playing.

308
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,836
Now it doesn't roll right.

309
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,425
So, can you fix it?

310
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,605
One of the axles is broken.

311
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,185
Okay, give me that.

312
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,400
Come on!

313
00:15:52,401 --> 00:15:54,165
Can't you just fix
it using alchemy?

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,936
No.

315
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,276
You shouldn't rely on
alchemy all the time.

316
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,245
If you can fix it with your
own hands, then you should.

317
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,656
There you go.

318
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:03,616
All fixed.

319
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,465
Yeah, but now it
looks really ugly.

320
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,320
There are far uglier sights.

321
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:12,771
In the future, if you want all your things to be so beautiful,
then I suggest you don't break them in the first place.

322
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,096
Bye, teacher.

323
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:16,925
Thanks a lot.

324
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,805
I'll be back if it breaks again.

325
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,865
Let's try to keep it
to once a day, please.

326
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:23,845
Teacher!

327
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,316
What is it, Menny?

328
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,025
What's wrong?

329
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,665
It's Chiko, my cat.

330
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,536
The cat must be up there!

331
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:46,405
I'm on it.

332
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,955
Nice cat!

333
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,675
Chiko?

334
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,255
Chiko?

335
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,695
Uh, teacher?

336
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,515
Is Chiko broken somewhere?

337
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:17,815
Hmm...

338
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:19,855
No, Menny.

339
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,475
Chiko's dead.

340
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:25,095
But you can make her
better, can't you, teacher?

341
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,615
You can fix anything.

342
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,375
You can fix Chiko, too.

343
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,535
No, I can't.

344
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:36,715
Lives and things are
different, and I'm not a god.

345
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,635
Chiko's life has ended, and
she isn't ever coming back.

346
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,515
But...

347
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,375
She was... She was just here!

348
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:54,446
I can't bring Chiko back for you, Menny,
but I can help you make a grave for her, okay?

349
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,915
How does that sound?

350
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:05,495
Everything that
lives has to die.

351
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,715
That's the nature of the world.

352
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:13,115
And when the body returns to the
soil, flowers will be nourished and bloom.

353
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:18,515
A soul impacts other souls
and lives on in other hearts.

354
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,855
Everything in this
world flows, circulates.

355
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,915
That goes for
human lives, as well.

356
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:40,370
Even for someone like me, who's come
to know so much on the subject, it's still

357
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:43,835
difficult to make a child understand
the actual nature of death.

358
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,725
Teacher...

359
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,685
Over all these years, have you ever wished
you could bring someone dead back to life?

360
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,085
That's the second time
you've asked me that, Ed.

361
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,045
I just asked out of curiosity.

362
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,445
What's this got to do
with my question, anyway?

363
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,185
The basis strength of a transmutation
circle is the nature of the shape itself.

364
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,925
The circle represents
the circulation of power.

365
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,705
By drawing it, that
power can be evoked.

366
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:32,569
By understanding this circulation of power and the
laws that govern it, you can harness it for yourself.

367
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:41,425
And one who works within this system of flow
to create new things, that is the true Alchemist.

368
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:46,165
The world, all of us, follow
the motion of a great current.

369
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,345
Every living being's
death is part of that flow.

370
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:52,085
And reviving them
would disrupt it.

371
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,765
We mustn't do that.

372
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,705
Al, that armor
is empty, isn't it?

373
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,885
Ed, your arm and leg
are automail, right?

374
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,685
How'd you find out?

375
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,665
Your weight when I threw you.

376
00:20:07,715 --> 00:20:09,185
The sound of your steps.

377
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,949
You thought I wouldn't notice?

378
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,505
You fools.

379
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:15,356
Teacher... On the roof.

380
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,545
You didn't use a
transmutation circle, did you?

381
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,245
So come on, tell me, Ed.

382
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,485
Did you actually see it?

383
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,305
Yes.

384
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,825
How did it happen?

385
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,365
Tell me everything.

386
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,685
Teacher...

387
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,545
I...

388
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,765
We...
No...

389
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,305
We transmuted...
transmuted our mother!

390
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:52,765
Ah!

391
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:12,989
[Ass Kicking Continues]

392
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:39,726
Full Metal Alchemist.

393
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,955
Episode 28.

394
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:43,315
All is one, one is all.

395
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,724
It's the core of
alchemic theory.

396
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:51,135
As imperfect as we are,
the entire world lies within us.
