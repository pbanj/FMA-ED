1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:04,710
I knew you would come.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,770
You must feel, as I do, the connection
between us.

3
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,230
A lot has happened between you brothers
and me.

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,070
But really, we are very much alike,
don't you agree?

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:15,990
Yes, very much alike indeed.

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,361
In fact, Al, I guess that's why Edward
felt uneasy about seeing me today, right?

7
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:25,230
My brother's not sure we should use the
Philosopher's Stone.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:31,290
How peculiar that he would hesitate now,
after all the trouble you've gone to, to find it.

9
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:34,050
We've worked hard to gain back what we
lost.

10
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:36,890
That's still the only thing that matters
to us.

11
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,840
Does it hurt, Nina?

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:56,260
Everything will be alright.

13
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,960
The preparations are complete,
my dear.

14
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,870
Constructed bodies, and the sacrificed
lives of many different animals.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,030
Now I only need to complete my creation.

16
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,610
Using your Philosopher's Stone.

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,090
How did you know we had it?

18
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,450
Or that it was made?

19
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:23,230
Actually, it was quite simple.

20
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,330
By looking at Archer's wounds, I could
tell exactly what had happened in Lior.

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:30,110
Especially since Scar was there.

22
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,610
Then there's the Führer.

23
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,350
I heard how badly he wanted to find you
and your brother.

24
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,910
And Homunculi like Bradley only chases one
thing.

25
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,370
The Philosopher's Stone.

26
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:40,830
What?

27
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,470
You knew the Führer was a Homunculus?

28
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:50,150
Alphonse, my boy, do you have any idea how much time
I spent working in the Fifth Laboratory with all of them?

29
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:52,690
He felt no need to hide himself from me.

30
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:54,110
Neither did the other one.

31
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:54,990
The other one?

32
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,910
The one who gathered the Homunculi,
raised them, and led them all.

33
00:01:58,930 --> 00:01:59,530
Wait a minute!

34
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:02,950
Then you can tell me who it is
that... We'll talk about that later.

35
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,830
You have something they want quite badly.

36
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,470
Something we've all been searching for.

37
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:10,250
Now please, let me see it at last,
after all these years.

38
00:02:10,251 --> 00:02:11,850
Where's the real Philosopher's Stone?

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:15,250
Please, don't touch me!

40
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,890
I am the Philosopher's Stone.

41
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,390
I hadn't realized it.

42
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,070
But I suppose this does explain your
brother's reluctance.

43
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,490
Yes.

44
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,530
If we use the stone, there's no telling
what could happen to me.

45
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:35,030
He wants to study it more.

46
00:02:35,230 --> 00:02:39,410
But he said he has some business to finish
with the Homunculi before we can do anything.

47
00:02:39,411 --> 00:02:41,490
I understand he's worried about me.

48
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:41,950
I do.

49
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,750
But I don't want to wait anymore.

50
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:46,090
I want his body to be whole again.

51
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:52,670
So please, if you know how... Of course,
Alphonse, I can teach you how to use the stone.

52
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,150
But in return, I'd like you to let me use
its powers as well.

53
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:00,890
That is equivalent exchange, after all.

54
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,070
The Philosopher's Stone.

55
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:12,650
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange and

56
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:18,570
alchemy, may gain without sacrifice,
create without equal exchange.

57
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,810
We searched for it.

58
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:23,770
And we found it.

59
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,410
Most of her books have disappeared.

60
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,530
Those left are useless.

61
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,290
Tell me about Dante.

62
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,030
I mean, what kind of person was she?

63
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:20,230
A great Alchemist from a long line of
them, who inherited this crest.

64
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,950
Or so I thought.

65
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:22,844
What do you mean?

66
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,770
She was extremely thorough at hiding her
knowledge of Alchemy.

67
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,510
I'm sure she knew more than she told me.

68
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,490
There's nothing wrong with that,
is there?

69
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:35,450
We encrypt our alchemic secrets,
too, when we record them, don't we?

70
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:38,230
Yes, well, she was certainly a master at
doing that.

71
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,350
If alchemy is truly meant for the
well-being of people, why do we hide it?

72
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,330
She chose a life of isolation,
living in these woods, seeing no one.

73
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,130
But for what purpose?

74
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,480
I was hoping you'd be happy for me.

75
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,940
Do not expect me to coddle you,
Izumi.

76
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,180
I haven't the talent for it.

77
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,500
I'm leaving you and this forest.

78
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,080
I'm going to live in the city among the
people who need me.

79
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,380
If approval is what you're looking for, then you
might as well enlist and become a State Alchemist.

80
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,717
I've heard they praise their dogs well in
the Military.

81
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,980
Tell me something.

82
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,980
I think you should go now.

83
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:25,720
Did you ever... did you ever love anyone
other than yourself, Dante?

84
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,980
Why should I love any human being?

85
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,960
They are all ignorant, egotistical things
beyond any redemption.

86
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,680
Once they learned how to use gunpowder,
they thought only about waging war.

87
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:42,040
If they ever understood the secrets of
Alchemy, what a horrible tragedy that would be.

88
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:44,600
Don't forget that I am a human being,
Dante!

89
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,260
And that you are too!

90
00:06:53,755 --> 00:06:57,160
There was one name that was never to be
spoken in front of her.

91
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,120
That name was Hohenheim of Light.

92
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,690
My father?

93
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,310
Yes.

94
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,070
This is the only useful thing I've found.

95
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,270
It's a love letter.

96
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,790
From Hohenheim to Dante, years ago.

97
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,150
Wait a minute!

98
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,490
You can't tell me that!

99
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:21,530
I met Dante!

100
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,470
She was an old hag!

101
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,670
She was at least 20 years older than my
dad!

102
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,430
There's no way!

103
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,272
That's not the only problem with this.

104
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:30,650
The year is indicated there based on the
birth of Christ.

105
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,770
The birth of Christ?

106
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:33,790
The dating system isn't used anymore.

107
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,770
It's derived from an ancient religion.

108
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,310
One that hasn't been practiced for
centuries.

109
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:41,130
That date was 400 years ago.

110
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,540
So what do you make of all this?

111
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't know.

112
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,640
Maybe the names are only a coincidence.

113
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,540
Maybe so.

114
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,040
Or maybe she's the one who's been
controlling all the Homunculi.

115
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,180
That's quite a leap.

116
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:01,720
But if that is the case, are you prepared?

117
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,840
I wasn't much of a help.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,300
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,820
It's okay.

120
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,220
I'd Wrather finish on my own anyway.

121
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:16,868
Teacher?

122
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:22,550
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:26,135 --> 00:08:27,390
Go on, you fool.

124
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,310
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,800
What are you going to do now?

126
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,560
Start a war up north, apparently.

127
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,040
The Führer won't stop until we're all
dead.

128
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,200
I just wish I could be there to help,
you know?

129
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,420
It's almost time, sir.

130
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,760
Well, at least you won't be lonely now.

131
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,440
Your companion is here.

132
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,280
Master Sergeant Fury.

133
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,760
During your last physical examination,
we discovered Athlete's Foot.

134
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:09,440
And we now believe that it is affecting
your brain.

135
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,558
Sorry about this, Sergeant.

136
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,280
Guess we just can't mobilize you.

137
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:22,410
Hmm.

138
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,630
Not bad at all.

139
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,050
That's very funny, sir.

140
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:35,190
Drachma has been taking part in subversive
plots against our government.

141
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,006
This is a border dispute that was solved
long ago.

142
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:40,230
But they have chosen to disregard our
treaties.

143
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:44,750
The Führer has considered all possible
strategies and made a wise decision.

144
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:49,590
We will gather our Military forces in the mountain
range at the border and expel the rebel invaders.

145
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,810
Those we send to represent us in this
crucial show of force are the greatest among us.

146
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:55,890
Soldiers.

147
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:56,730
Champions.

148
00:09:57,430 --> 00:09:57,990
Heroes.

149
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,370
I apologize for forcing so many difficult
missions on you.

150
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:05,430
It's been an honor to serve you,
sir.

151
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,798
I want you to know that I consider the doubts
about you completely unfounded, Mustang.

152
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,590
I believe that this is proof.

153
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,930
I won't let you down, sir.

154
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:15,330
You can depend on me.

155
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,310
Good luck to you.

156
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,250
I will await your safe return.

157
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,290
As for you, Lieutenant Colonel Armstrong,
please do your best to look after him.

158
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:24,950
Of course.

159
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:30,370
But, sir, I must say I'm concerned about our defenses
in Central if we concentrate our troops in the North.

160
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,750
Don't worry about that.

161
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:34,130
Frank Archer will be heading our defense.

162
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:34,750
Archer?

163
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,150
He's still alive?

164
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,030
But how?

165
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,780
Thank you for your hard work, Führer.

166
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,480
You know there are no legends about the
Philosopher's Stone in the North.

167
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:27,040
Even if we provoke them, no one there will
know how to create a Philosopher's Stone.

168
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
It doesn't matter.

169
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,020
Our only objective this time is to cover
up our tracks.

170
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:35,300
Those who have been close to the
Philosopher's Stone will die.

171
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,300
There will be no exceptions for your
soldiers.

172
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,620
So Mustang's not the only one you're
after?

173
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,565
Of course.

174
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,420
Anyone who had any kind of connection with
Maes Hughes will be killed in action.

175
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,340
Envy's going to see to it.

176
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,400
Are you talking about me?

177
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,220
Envy, didn't I tell you to head North?

178
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,800
I heard he'd be here.

179
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,240
Don't be rude, Envy.

180
00:11:58,675 --> 00:12:00,400
Get out of my way, you puppet!

181
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,180
Don't insult my work, Envy.

182
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,880
A Homunculus who can age like a human is
hardly a puppet.

183
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,480
He's my greatest masterpiece.

184
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:09,820
Where is he?

185
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,800
Who precisely is he?

186
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't play dumb!

187
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:13,980
You know who I mean!

188
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,594
The bastard who made me the way you made
Greed and Pride!

189
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,340
The one who's been jerking me around!

190
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,140
Oh, yes.

191
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,880
You mean Hohenheim.

192
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,720
He came here!

193
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,660
I know he did!

194
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,500
So where is he?

195
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,500
Missing your father?

196
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,320
I'm touched.

197
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,140
Tell me where he is now!

198
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,160
He's dead.

199
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,260
He's not!

200
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,020
He can't be dead yet!

201
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,380
I'm going to kill him myself!

202
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:42,860
I broke the union of his soul,
his mind, and his body.

203
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,340
He's as good as dead.

204
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,640
No, it can't be!

205
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,320
Why didn't you tell me?

206
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,960
It was for me to do!

207
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:50,680
Me!

208
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:51,040
Me!

209
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,380
Me!

210
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:55,040
Of course, his sons are still alive,
you know.

211
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,280
It was for me!

212
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,863
They have the Philosopher's Stone with
them, but then I'm sure you knew that.

213
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,300
They have the Stone?

214
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,260
Are you sure about that?

215
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,340
Positive.

216
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,680
And if things continue the way they are,
they will regain everything they lost.

217
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,780
No.

218
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,760
Such a shame, isn't it?

219
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:17,060
Those two boys he loved are going to
regain everything, and you alone,

220
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,720
who should have been his most treasured
child, you will gain nothing.

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,780
They won't.

222
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,380
I want to witness their faces as I take
the Philosopher's Stone away from them.

223
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,300
I want to witness them lose everything.

224
00:13:37,005 --> 00:13:39,150
This note says that he went to see Tucker.

225
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,470
That's Shou Tucker.

226
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:42,790
I thought we'd seen the last of him in
Lior.

227
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:44,390
Interesting.

228
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,850
So why do you think old Tucker got in
contact with him all of a sudden?

229
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:48,930
Isn't it obvious?

230
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:52,650
He wants to complete that useless Chimera
he's obsessed with.

231
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,970
His daughter, Nina.

232
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,530
Tucker learned a lot about the Stone while
working in Laboratory Five.

233
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,210
He knows what it's capable of.

234
00:13:59,211 --> 00:14:04,710
If he learned that much about the way the Stone works,
then he must know enough to teach the boy how to use it.

235
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,930
Why don't you tell me what you're thinking
about, Lust?

236
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:12,410
WWrath, dear.

237
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,350
Take care of things while I'm gone.

238
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,490
You're leaving?

239
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,930
For a little while.

240
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:27,310
You know, you're
brother really is a genius.

241
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,930
He's the one who thought of that
seven-point array.

242
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,150
Made it up on the spot by himself.

243
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:34,870
And you just imitated it?

244
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,090
I would like to claim that I made some
improvements.

245
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,230
But in all honesty, Edward's first attempt
was as close to perfect as mine will ever be.

246
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:48,990
Somehow he must have known that this complex
array is the only way to activate the Philosopher's Stone.

247
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,550
So he does know.

248
00:14:51,910 --> 00:14:53,710
He's just trying to protect me.

249
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:58,050
You know, despite the fact that getting
your body back has been his highest

250
00:14:58,051 --> 00:15:01,710
priority for all these years, I don't
believe that your brother has any

251
00:15:01,711 --> 00:15:04,970
intention of using the Stone now that
you've finally obtained it.

252
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:05,550
Why not?

253
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,970
Perhaps it's because...

254
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,530
Nothing.

255
00:15:13,531 --> 00:15:15,390
Will you come over here, please?

256
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,470
Tucker!

257
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,490
I'm afraid I have to insist that my
payment come first, Al.

258
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:35,228
You understand.

259
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:41,170
But such a large Philosopher's Stone as you should be more
than enough to resurrect my little Nina, don't you agree?

260
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:41,930
No, wait!

261
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,310
I'm not ready yet!

262
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,310
Oh, Nina.

263
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:45,030
Nina.

264
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,770
It's time, my dear.

265
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,410
Tucker!

266
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:52,190
Al?

267
00:15:53,491 --> 00:15:54,050
Al!

268
00:15:58,380 --> 00:15:59,660
Don't even try it.

269
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,860
You're looking well for a fugitive of the
Military.

270
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,100
My brother told me who you are.

271
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:07,680
What you really are.

272
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,180
I'm nothing but myself.

273
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,180
Catchy.

274
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,360
Oh, I'm sorry, boy.

275
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,760
Did you want something in here?

276
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,420
I told you I know what you really are!

277
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:24,600
Today's the day.

278
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,760
I'll take this.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,720
Sorry, my arm's not for sale.

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Let go!

281
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,640
Okay, Wrath.

282
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,780
Don't bother begging for your life,
Elric.

283
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:43,920
I wasn't about to.

284
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,400
I was just going to say go ahead.

285
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,220
Take my arms and my legs, too.

286
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,140
I don't even care.

287
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:52,400
I've got the best Automail Mechanic in
the world.

288
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,618
What are you talking about?

289
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,440
Ask yourself this, Wrath.

290
00:16:55,970 --> 00:17:00,380
If you take my arm and my leg and attach
them to your body, do you really think

291
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,872
that'll make you a human being?

292
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,440
I have artificial limbs and Al's a suit of
armor.

293
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:08,220
But our souls make us human beings,
not our bodies.

294
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,180
And that's something you'll never have!

295
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,160
Just shut up!

296
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,160
Why are you just standing there?

297
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,280
Kill him!

298
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,557
You know what'll happen if we have to go
back there and tell her we failed again!

299
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,180
Kill him now, Lust!

300
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,120
I guess you want to become a human,
too, now don't you?

301
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:40,720
If there is a Philosopher's Stone

302
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,580
then Shou Tucker is teaching your brother
to use it as we speak.

303
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:51,760
Let's say, that you did know how to use it.

304
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,040
Stop, Lust!

305
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:54,260
We can't talk to him!

306
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,260
Then would you?

307
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,060
Would you make me a human being?

308
00:17:59,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Traitor!

309
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,500
What the hell are you trying here?

310
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,640
I already told you.

311
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,580
Oh, come on.

312
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:09,955
If you really think I would turn you guys into
humans, you're even crazier than I thought you were.

313
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,880
Why wouldn't you?

314
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,280
If you transformed all of us Homunculi into
humans, then we wouldn't be chasing you anymore.

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,080
You'd have no more enemies, would you?

316
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,580
Traitor!

317
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:20,980
Traitor!

318
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:21,440
Traitor!

319
00:18:26,865 --> 00:18:29,300
You just couldn't be patient, could you?

320
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:34,000
Didn't she already say she'd make us into
humans if we found the Philosopher's Stone for her?

321
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,340
I don't believe her.

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can't.

323
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,700
I know she just wants the philosopher's
stone to prolong her own life.

324
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,940
For that reason, countless wars have been
fought.

325
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,640
You know our master has no intention of
ever making us all human.

326
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,980
Well, I've never really cared if she helps
me or not.

327
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,820
I've got my own strategy for becoming a
human, Lust.

328
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,580
I guess it's just like our master said.

329
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,760
You really can't be trusted, can you?

330
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,700
I'll do all of us a favor.

331
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,350
Let's go.

332
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,960
We have to hurry.

333
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:31,245
Sloth went after your brother a while ago.

334
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:33,760
Do you know where Al was going to meet
Tucker?

335
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:36,980
The factory where he worked before he
became a State Alchemist is nearby.

336
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,242
I assume they went there.

337
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,460
Wait!

338
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,560
Wait a minute!

339
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,040
I didn't promise you anything,
you know.

340
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:46,580
Why?

341
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm the one who should be asking why.

342
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,760
Why do you want to be human?

343
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,680
You guys are immortal, aren't you?

344
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,086
And you don't even age at all,
from what I can tell.

345
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,900
You can't be hurt, and you have powers no
human being can ever top.

346
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,754
So why should I believe you when you say
you want to give all that up?

347
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,820
You don't know how cruel you're being,
do you?

348
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,360
All right.

349
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,522
Why do you want your brother to return to
the flesh?

350
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,840
He's practically immortal too now.

351
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,120
It's the same thing, Edward.

352
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,320
Hold it!

353
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,800
The person you were talking about!

354
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:20,940
The one you call master!

355
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,060
Just tell me one thing.

356
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,880
Is it somebody that I know?

357
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,600
You know something?

358
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,980
If you make me human, I just might answer
that question.

359
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:34,180
Hey!

360
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,280
Don't forget!

361
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,520
I still have your weakness, you know.

362
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,920
No, Edward.

363
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,760
I won't forget about that.

364
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:48,920
Nina, sweetheart.

365
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,580
What happened?

366
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,375
It's really you.

367
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,470
Oh, Alphonse, you're awake.

368
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:02,950
Look who it is.

369
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,710
Nina.

370
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:09,590
Darling, do you understand what I'm
saying?

371
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:10,970
Do you, Nina?

372
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,450
Listen carefully, darling.

373
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,070
I want you to see Daddy.

374
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:16,830
There's no soul.

375
00:21:26,450 --> 00:21:28,550
Congratulations, Mr. Tucker.

376
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,430
A perfect human transmutation.

377
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,210
It's all right.

378
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:37,090
I didn't come all this way to take that
soulless doll away from you.

379
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,810
It takes a very strong will to attach a
soul.

380
00:21:39,811 --> 00:21:43,570
So I'm sure you are aware that it wasn't
possible for you.

381
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,350
Come, Alphonse Elric.

382
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,430
It's time for us to go.

383
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,650
We can't let that long-awaited
Philosopher's Stone erode anymore.

384
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:52,870
Erode?

385
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,510
What do you mean?

386
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:02,270
No!

387
00:22:02,271 --> 00:22:02,830
Brother!

388
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:04,710
What's happening to me?

389
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,690
Is this really the Philosopher's Stone?

390
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,370
Fullmetal Alchemist.

391
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:43,810
Episode 47,
Sealing the Homunculus.

392
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:45,630
Look, Sloth.

393
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,430
Your weakness is here.
