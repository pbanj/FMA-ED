1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,510
Look, he's awake.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,606
Thank goodness.

3
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:08,598
Are you feeling okay?

4
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,150
I guess.

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,710
Where's Al?

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,860
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,560
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,860
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

9
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:48,780
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

10
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,606
Sorry, Al.

11
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:28,906
That's twice now
you've been carved up.

12
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,550
I'll fix you right away.

13
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:32,870
Yeah.

14
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,796
Edward, sir, that was
some stir you caused.

15
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,340
What happened to you in Lab 5?

16
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,276
Nothing much.

17
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,260
Nothing much?

18
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,120
You and Al were seriously hurt!

19
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,920
Come on, I've had a lot worse.

20
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:51,820
I was just one baby step away from
getting my hands on the truth, too.

21
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,336
I won't botch it next time.

22
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:03,982
Edward, sir!

23
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
I apologize in advance for this.

24
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,800
You nearly died, and you
put your brother at risk.

25
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,400
You need to remember
you're still a child.

26
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:25,580
And you have to start trusting
adults with a little bit more of the work.

27
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,916
My conduct was improper
for a lower officer, sir.

28
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,580
Forgive me.

29
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,080
Forgive me, too, sir!

30
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,480
No, you've got a point.

31
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,780
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,560
Yep, he's gonna hate me.

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,540
It's one of his
parts, all right.

34
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,376
Oh, how could this happen?

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,980
I've been praised as a young,
gifted automail engineer!

36
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,500
It's the worst
mistake of my career!

37
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,740
Is something the matter?

38
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,336
No, nothing at all!

39
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,360
I just, uh, I hit my
thumb with a wrench.

40
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:08,620
Hello, Rockbell Automail
Prosthetic Limb Outfitters.

41
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,080
Uh, Winry?

42
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,240
Ed, hi there.

43
00:04:12,595 --> 00:04:14,120
I've got some kind of problem.

44
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,076
I can't move my arm anymore.

45
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,900
Sounds right.

46
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,516
Why?

47
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,336
What do you mean?

48
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,196
Uh, nothing at all.

49
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:21,816
I just, I told you I made it lighter,
and it would be a little more fragile.

50
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,000
That's why it makes sense.

51
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,620
You've done something
reckless again, haven't you?

52
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,840
Anyway, I can't make it out to Risembool
right now, so I'm kind of a fix here.

53
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,336
Don't worry!

54
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,280
I'll come to you!

55
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,980
Just stay there and relax,
and I'll jump on the train today!

56
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,460
You're being unusually
kind today, Winry.

57
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,676
Oh, don't be silly.

58
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,260
You know I'm always kind, Ed.

59
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:41,740
Right.

60
00:04:41,741 --> 00:04:42,536
See you here.

61
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,080
Thanks.

62
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:44,440
Huh.

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,740
Make sure you do the
maintenance right this time, kid.

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,780
Right.

65
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,460
Just following orders.

66
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,696
I don't know what's in there.

67
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,420
The Splatterpot is bizarre.

68
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Hey, Edward.

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,460
I heard that you've been
up and around today.

70
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:14,820
Yeah, a little.

71
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,056
How about you, Al?

72
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,971
You holding up too?

73
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,860
Sure.

74
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,140
Oh, I forgot.

75
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,420
I haven't had lunch.

76
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,556
Oh, well, I'll get
you some food, sir.

77
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:25,876
Yeah.

78
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,960
Lieutenant Ross, why
don't you go with him?

79
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,840
Understood, sir.

80
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,340
Thanks.

81
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,396
I'm real hungry.

82
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,740
I've just been so busy.

83
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,140
About Lab 5...

84
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:50,680
As far as the official military report
goes, everything that happened there is

85
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:53,976
considered collateral damage caused
by Scar while he was pursuing you.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,980
But needless to say, I'm
not really convinced of that.

87
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,980
We found a lot of corpses we suspect
were chimeras, and a great deal of

88
00:06:02,981 --> 00:06:06,360
sophisticated equipment I can't help
but think was working until yesterday.

89
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:10,380
And surviving prisoners claim they were
taken there by Brigadier General Grand,

90
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:13,340
who we both know is in a
grave with an exploded skull.

91
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,740
Ed, what the hell happened?

92
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:20,380
Ed?

93
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,716
How should I know?

94
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,980
I passed out.

95
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,236
Don't give me that.

96
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,100
Just tell me what
you saw, will ya?

97
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,360
Homunculi.

98
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,960
You're kidding me.

99
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,800
Artificial people?

100
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,820
That's right.

101
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:48,580
Believe me, they
weren't human at all.

102
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,820
So they're connected with
the Philosopher's Stone?

103
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,840
I'll say.

104
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,380
They were trying to convince me to
create a stone for them to make them human.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,480
And worse, they wanted me to
use those prisoners to pull it off.

106
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,660
That's hard to believe.

107
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,780
Tell him Al, isn't that right?

108
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,020
Yes.

109
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,900
A guardian whose soul
was attached to armor.

110
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,620
A psychopath named Envy.

111
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,020
Tattoos of Ouroboros, the
serpent that devours its own tail.

112
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,820
And the arrays to make
a Philosopher's Stone.

113
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,760
Those are the things I
saw in there, Hughes.

114
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,560
This is turning into an awfully serious matter,
and the whole thing is about a little red stone.

115
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,660
It's been serious for years now.

116
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:42,800
Dr. Marcoh told me the stone was used
as a weapon in the Eastern Rebellion.

117
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:48,600
Anyway, these homunculi told me they
were keeping me alive for their sakes.

118
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:49,960
That they were told to.

119
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,880
Thanks for the information, Ed.

120
00:07:53,945 --> 00:07:54,990
I'll take it from here.

121
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,380
Now get some rest.

122
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,640
Why don't you and your brother just
worry about yourselves for a while?

123
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,180
Ah, cushionless seats.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,540
Let's see... Ed said he'd have
a sign for me or something.

125
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,676
My warmest welcome, Winry.

126
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for going to the
trouble of this late victory.

127
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,060
That works.

128
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,340
Edward, you didn't tell me that you
were in the hospital for this!

129
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,560
Yeah, well, one
thing led to another.

130
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,680
It's nothing to laugh about.

131
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,380
What's wrong?

132
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,520
I didn't do the maintenance on
your automail the way I should've.

133
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,880
And now... This is my fault.

134
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,476
No, don't say that!

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,660
There's a lot of other
things to blame, right, Al?

136
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,060
Right.

137
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,176
See there?

138
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,091
And Al doesn't lie.

139
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,516
Yeah, but... Your
maintenance was perfect.

140
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,480
It always has been.

141
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,480
It's complicated machinery,
and I'm slinging it all around.

142
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,020
It was bound to jam up sometime.

143
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:06,036
I mean, honestly, the
timing was pretty good.

144
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,496
If it had stopped earlier,
I'd be a lot worse off.

145
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,396
It broke because
I was rough with it.

146
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,042
Don't worry.

147
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,460
Could he actually not have noticed
that I forgot to use that screw?

148
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,936
You're right, Ed.

149
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:17,620
You're too rough.

150
00:09:17,661 --> 00:09:18,900
I'm reckless klutz, really.

151
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,320
Lieutenant Colonel, sorry to interrupt,
but there's a call from Colonel Mustang.

152
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,180
Yo, Roy!

153
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,020
Good timing!

154
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:38,989
I've got great news!

155
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,645
What, your soldiers
have found Scar?

156
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,240
No, you obsessed idiot!

157
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,555
How would that be great news?

158
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,980
Did you honestly forget?

159
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,720
Tomorrow is Elicia's birthday!

160
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,776
We're throwing her a
party and everything!

161
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,900
Unless you want to become Charcoal Maze,
you'd better tell me the news from Central.

162
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:52,740
Don't worry.

163
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,846
If anything important
happens, I'll let you know.

164
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,640
In the meantime, make sure
you send my daughter a present.

165
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,360
Bye now!

166
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,660
But, sir, are you sure it's
okay not to tell him anything?

167
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,760
About the boys?

168
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,320
Yeah, I'm sure.

169
00:10:07,885 --> 00:10:09,968
Right now, it's better if
he doesn't know anything.

170
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,100
Right.

171
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,216
But enough of that.

172
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,280
You got those reports?

173
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,580
Yeah!

174
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,460
Working nonstop without sleep,
I've managed to finish them all!

175
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:20,760
Great!

176
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,316
Here's a list of
what's next, doll.

177
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,776
Ah!

178
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,400
Oh!

179
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,680
How you doing?

180
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,220
Well, Ed, looks like you're
done with your dinner.

181
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,140
Uh-huh.

182
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,356
Don't be a baby.

183
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,460
It won't hurt much.

184
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,140
You didn't drink your milk.

185
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,380
Edward.

186
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,740
You drink it?

187
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,356
I hate milk.

188
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,600
It's like drinking vomit.

189
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,856
What are you talking about?

190
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,656
Milk's good for you!

191
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,216
Drink it!

192
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:49,800
Forget it!

193
00:10:49,801 --> 00:10:50,556
I hate what I hate!

194
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,616
It's not like I'll die because
I don't drink that crap!

195
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:52,956
Jeez!

196
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,596
Then this is the reason you're always
going to... It's gonna be the size of a bean!

197
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,156
A bean!

198
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,496
Yeah!

199
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,440
A bean!

200
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,640
Right, Al?

201
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,956
Just do what she says, Ed.

202
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,300
Drink the dumb milk.

203
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Yeah, sure.

204
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,796
Easy for you to say, Al.

205
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,540
You're lucky you didn't have
to drink anything to get that big.

206
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:13,740
Shut up.

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,020
It wasn't my choice
to be this way.

208
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,136
Right, Al.

209
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,800
I'm sorry.

210
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,716
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

211
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,554
Are you fighting?

212
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:26,680
Al?

213
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,056
I've never seen you like this.

214
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,048
Did something happen?

215
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,480
Why is that?

216
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,420
I've known you my whole life
and you don't tell me anything.

217
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:46,516
I'm standing here worrying about you guys, yet you
don't have the decency to tell me why you're fighting!

218
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:49,400
Or how you... got hurt
or anything important!

219
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,280
It's always secrets with you.

220
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,210
I don't care anymore!

221
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,590
Hi, it's nice to finally
meet you, Winry.

222
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,870
I'm Ed & Al's friend,
the Lieutenant Colonel.

223
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:07,050
Or, Maes Hughes.

224
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:07,910
Oh, hey.

225
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:09,830
Oh, and lest I forget...

226
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:12,090
This here is my
beautiful daughter, Elicia.

227
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,886
Isn't she a bundle
of divine cuteness?

228
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,266
You're dying to
meet her, aren't you?

229
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,290
Uh, yes, I guess.

230
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,870
Alright, then I'm gonna let you.

231
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,346
Don't you worry about Winry.

232
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,726
I'm gonna look
after her for a while.

233
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,270
Bye now.

234
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:24,711
Sir...

235
00:12:24,735 --> 00:12:25,666
This is gonna be great!

236
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,270
You have no idea how lucky
you are coming into town today!

237
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,930
It's Elicia's birthday tomorrow!

238
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,470
I forgot.

239
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,470
It's Ed's, too.

240
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,066
Ah, that's an excellent point.

241
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,266
We'll have to get him a
present, too, while we're out.

242
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,026
So, come on.

243
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,666
You can tell me.

244
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,606
I'm dying to know.

245
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:40,482
What kind of gift are
you getting for Elicia?

246
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,430
What?

247
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:43,446
A teddy bear?

248
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,930
One bigger than she is?

249
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:45,466
Great!

250
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:47,190
She'll absolutely love that!

251
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,635
Congratulations!

252
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,736
Happy birthday, Elicia!

253
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,800
She's getting so big!

254
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,696
I'm telling you, apples always
bake better with maple syrup.

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,420
Oh, they do!

256
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,416
You're lucky.

257
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,056
My daughter's
been a handful lately.

258
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,436
It looks really soft, too.

259
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,940
You should put him in an outfit.

260
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,960
Hi, Elicia!

261
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:17,320
You wanna see what I got you?

262
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,680
My favorite story
when I was a kid!

263
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,920
Oh, thank you!

264
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,040
Your dad's friend, the bookworm.

265
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,300
Bookworm?

266
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,480
You're pretty.

267
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,200
Hey there, Elicia.

268
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,000
Can you tell me how
old you are today?

269
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,460
One, two, three... I'm four!

270
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,091
Right!

271
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,420
You're so adorable!

272
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,020
Winry, you know what?

273
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,440
Hmm?

274
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,000
Congratulations,
congratulations, congratulations.

275
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Know why?

276
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,760
Daddy says when you tell someone
congratulations, good things will happen to them.

277
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,400
So I'm telling you!

278
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,580
Thank you.

279
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,260
That's sweet.

280
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,800
My, my.

281
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,580
If I didn't know, I'd think the
two of you were really sisters.

282
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:03,500
Do you think so?

283
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,400
I always wished I had
a little sister like this.

284
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,556
I'm just an only
child, after all.

285
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,460
You have brothers.

286
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,960
Two great ones.

287
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,540
No, I don't.

288
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:16,776
Real brothers would tell me things
and let me into their lives a little.

289
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,720
But those two have always kept me at
arm's length from anything that actually matters.

290
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,720
Sorry.

291
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,660
Can't help that.

292
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,940
Guys like them, they speak more
with their actions than their words.

293
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:28,416
They like people to be happy.

294
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,880
They do dangerous work and they don't
want to burden anyone else with their problems.

295
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,756
Or make them worry about them.

296
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,060
So they keep quiet.

297
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:39,816
But despite all that, when the pressure
valve breaks and they have to talk,

298
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,120
you're the one they'll go to.

299
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,420
Right?

300
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,840
You're the one they can
count on when they need to.

301
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,800
And that in itself says a lot.

302
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,920
But for brothers to count on their older sister,
she's going to have to be there and be strong.

303
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,160
That makes sense.

304
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,740
Here you go.

305
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,260
Thanks for waiting.

306
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,676
It's Edward's birthday
cake, fresh from the oven.

307
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,760
I hope he likes it.

308
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,656
Go on.

309
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,660
Go see him.

310
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,340
Here.

311
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,680
Oh, Mr. Hughes, don't you
have a present for Ed, too?

312
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,560
What's the point?

313
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,280
There's not a gift I could give him that
wouldn't dull in comparison to your smiling face.

314
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,039
Congratulations! Congratulations!
Congratulations, Ed.

315
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:36,770
Know why?

316
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:40,026
Because the more people tell you
congratulations on your birthday,

317
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:41,890
the more good things
will happen to you.

318
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:44,090
Huh.

319
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,470
Here it's from Gracia.

320
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:47,666
Okay.

321
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:48,410
Thank you.

322
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,206
It's a cake, and I copied
the recipe from her.

323
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,206
When you get your body back and
can eat Al, I'll make one for you, too.

324
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:54,830
Okay?

325
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:56,790
Whatever.

326
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,890
Oh, yeah.

327
00:15:57,975 --> 00:16:01,686
The three of us always used to eat
cake together on our birthdays, didn't we?

328
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,066
Yeah.

329
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,910
Remember when Den ate Al's cake?

330
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,346
We knew because of the paw
prints made with the frosting.

331
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:07,330
Al cried.

332
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,950
Yeah, that's right.

333
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,190
That happened to me?

334
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,246
Yeah.

335
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,146
You and the dog were
both pretty little then.

336
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,610
Why, you don't remember it?

337
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,030
No.

338
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,482
Something the matter, Al?

339
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:24,350
I'll be outside on the roof
until you're done repairing Ed.

340
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:27,650
Al...

341
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,226
Are you sure you'll
be okay out here?

342
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:33,179
I mean, by yourself?

343
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:33,750
Yeah.

344
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,810
All right.

345
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:37,050
Well, I'll come back
to move you later.

346
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,030
Thanks.

347
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,620
Ed, something happened
between you and Al, didn't it?

348
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,580
I... I did something
awful to him, Winry.

349
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,150
I had the chance to do it.

350
00:17:01,151 --> 00:17:02,770
To change him back to normal.

351
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,150
And I hesitated.

352
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:06,170
And how come?

353
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:12,370
Because in order for it to work, I would
have had to sacrifice some other people.

354
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,530
It all would have been for Al.

355
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:19,610
Compared to him, those other people
shouldn't have meant anything to me.

356
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,090
But I... I just couldn't do it.

357
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,626
Not with him watching me.

358
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,090
My conscience got in the way.

359
00:17:28,855 --> 00:17:30,190
It's a good thing it did.

360
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:33,546
After all, Al is a
selfless person.

361
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,307
He wouldn't have
been happy in that body.

362
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:38,266
Even if it's what he wants most,
how could he take that burden,

363
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,630
seeing the ones who died
every time he looked at his skin?

364
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:42,290
I promised.

365
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,086
Think about it.

366
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,650
Maybe there's another reason.

367
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:49,910
Maybe he's upset because he saw the brother he
idolizes even consider taking someone else's life.

368
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,616
How do you know you don't love
him because he made it so you would?

369
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,500
Tailored your memories and
personality to suit him best!

370
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,080
I can implant those in the
mind of the homunculus.

371
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,860
Giving birth to a Nina
even more perfect.

372
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:12,320
Was I ever really human at all?

373
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,370
All done.

374
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:22,230
Come on now, let's go
have you take care of Al.

375
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,590
Yeah, but... I have no
idea what to say to him.

376
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,170
Just say sorry, you goof.

377
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,710
A simple apology.

378
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:29,766
It isn't hard to do.

379
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,350
You rant for hours and
you can't say two words?

380
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:36,310
Yeah, let's go.

381
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,820
Listen, I'm sorry.

382
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,080
And I'm gonna fix you right now.

383
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,260
I brought these
parts from Risembool.

384
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,525
They should be enough.

385
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,280
Trust me.

386
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,540
I'm not gonna give
up on this yet, Al.

387
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,200
We're gonna do this, but
we'll do it the right way.

388
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,900
And we'll be normal again.

389
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,960
I'm sure.

390
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,500
Maybe you can go
back to normal, brother.

391
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:12,640
And I hope you do.

392
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,240
But I'm not sure I ever can.

393
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,380
Al, what are you talking about?

394
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,960
Of course you can, Al.

395
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,140
Here goes.

396
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,160
How's that?

397
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:51,820
That's how you made me this way when you
attached my soul to this armor in the first place, isn't it?

398
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,700
That's right.

399
00:19:53,515 --> 00:19:55,080
Along with my memories.

400
00:19:56,300 --> 00:20:01,200
After all, memories are just information
you can reference, like a cabinet of files.

401
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,620
As skilled an alchemist as you are, you could
have created any memories you wanted me to have.

402
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,420
Fake memories?

403
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,496
Don't tell me that's
what you're upset about.

404
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,640
Why shouldn't it be?

405
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:18,296
A while back in Risembool, there was
something you wanted to tell me, but you couldn't.

406
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,580
You said you were
afraid of how I'd react.

407
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,320
You remember that, don't you?

408
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,360
I can't remember parts of my
past because they never happened.

409
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,560
My memories and
my soul are fake.

410
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,840
Something you created.

411
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,676
Isn't that what
you wanted to say?

412
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,100
No!

413
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,160
What Ed wanted to tell you
was that... Stop lying to me!

414
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,176
I know what the truth is.

415
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,700
The person named Alphonse
Elric never existed at all.

416
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,140
That makes no sense!

417
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,956
You and Ed have
always been together!

418
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,376
I knew you when you were a boy!

419
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,500
My grandma did too!

420
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:50,640
We're friends, Al!

421
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,740
You can trust me!

422
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,300
Can I?

423
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,300
Really?

424
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,396
How can I believe anyone
when there's no way to prove it?

425
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,140
When I'm just a hollow shell?

426
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,680
All three of you can
be in on it together!

427
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:09,200
So... you've been sitting on
those thoughts all this time.

428
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,380
Is there anything
else you're hiding?

429
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,940
That you want to say?

430
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,060
What about you,
my so-called brother?

431
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,000
Answer my question!

432
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,840
Why won't you say anything?

433
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,500
Unless it's truth!

434
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,960
Let go of me!

435
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,140
What's the point
of living this lie?

436
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:27,700
You idiot!

437
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,196
Let go of me!

438
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,060
Let go!

439
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:31,980
Al!

440
00:21:31,981 --> 00:21:32,700
Stop!

441
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:36,860
I won't stay here!

442
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:37,880
Edward!

443
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,840
Alphonse...

444
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,660
Stay back!

445
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,340
Hold on...

446
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,500
Just stay back!

447
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,520
Keep away from me!

448
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,020
Please, Al!

449
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,000
Al!

450
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,360
Wait!

451
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,380
Ed, no!

452
00:22:07,804 --> 00:22:08,804
AL!

453
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,728
AL!!!!!!

454
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,136
Full Metal Alchemist.

455
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,180
Episode 24.

456
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,020
Bonding Memories.

457
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,740
Even if everyone else has
forgotten, I still remember.

458
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,196
Your voice.

459
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,480
Your warmth.

460
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,740
Your smile.
