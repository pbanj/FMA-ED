1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,083
Do you really think we're gonna find the
Philosopher's Stone in a rundown town like this?

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:12,990
Looking around, it's hard to believe
they ever produced much gold at all.

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,630
Which is why they're all the more likely
to be developing a Philosopher's Stone.

4
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:18,323
What do you mean?

5
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:22,050
Now that their mines are no longer
producing gold, they've got plenty of

6
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,370
reason to want to transmute it.

7
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:26,170
And they could only do that
with a Philosopher's Stone.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,450
What, with this being a former gold
mining town, it wouldn't look too suspicious.

9
00:00:30,451 --> 00:00:33,831
Is money all that
grown-ups think about?

10
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:34,770
Elisa!

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:36,710
Hey, get over here.

12
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:37,310
Give me a hand.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,860
It's no use.

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,740
It won't budge.

15
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,640
Daddy?

16
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,820
It's alright.

17
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,180
We'll get you out of this.

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,840
I promise.

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,313
What's wrong?

20
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,220
My daughter!

21
00:00:58,340 --> 00:00:58,859
She's trapped!

22
00:01:06,747 --> 00:01:08,466
Hold still for just a minute.

23
00:01:22,778 --> 00:01:24,178
OOH, WOW.

24
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,800
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

25
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:36,500
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

26
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,960
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

27
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:47,654
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

28
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:32,994
Fullmetal Alchemist, Episode 11:
The Other Brothers Elric, part one.

29
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:38,740
I mean it.

30
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,000
We sure were lucky to have a real
alchemist like you show up when you did.

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,500
I can't begin to
thank you enough.

32
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,760
And don't forget
about his metal father.

33
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,540
No, you've got it all wrong.

34
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,760
Al's not my father.

35
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,240
He's actually my
younger brother.

36
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,240
Younger brother?

37
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,740
But he's so much
bigger than you are.

38
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,288
Anyway, we're both just
glad that you're okay, Elisa.

39
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,340
Elisa!

40
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,395
Elisa, are you alright?

41
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,220
Uncle Belsio!

42
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:13,920
Daddy?

43
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,400
Get out.

44
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,560
You've got some nerve showing your face
in my house now, after almost getting my poor

45
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,672
daughter killed.

46
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,000
Listen to me, Elisa.

47
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,940
No matter what he says, you are not
to help him with his work ever again.

48
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,400
No, Daddy.

49
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:32,680
None of that was
Uncle Belsio's idea.

50
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,040
I was the one who begged
him to let me help out.

51
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:37,180
I'm sorry, sweetie.

52
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,022
Here, drink this.

53
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:53,495
I am sorry.

54
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,220
Uncle Belsio told me your lemon
pies were always the best, Daddy.

55
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,660
And that it was a shame all
the lemon farms were shut down.

56
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,480
I thought maybe if I helped
him, I could taste your pie.

57
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,140
Don't worry.

58
00:05:13,151 --> 00:05:16,280
Once the Philosopher's Stone is
finished, we'll all be rich, and then we

59
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:19,100
can afford to buy all the fruit
we want from some other town.

60
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,321
Philosopher's Stone?

61
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,100
Yes.

62
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,740
That's it.

63
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,180
The two of you must have come here
to Xenotime to assist Mr. Mugear with his

64
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:28,160
research, and finish
the Philosopher's Stone.

65
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,840
Please, do everything
in your power.

66
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,200
Make it as fast as you can.

67
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,160
We want Xenotime to once
again be the town of gold.

68
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,120
We must reclaim
what's rightfully ours.

69
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,822
That's right.

70
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,200
We're counting
on you alchemists.

71
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,820
Our children must
not suffer any longer.

72
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:42,780
Eh.

73
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:45,380
Wow, that really puts
a lot of pressure on us.

74
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,740
I guess we'll just have to visit
Mugear now and see what we can do.

75
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,760
Before you go, could you tell
us the names of our saviors?

76
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:53,680
Certainly.

77
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,640
I'm Edward Elric.

78
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,640
The Full Metal Alchemist.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,140
And I'm his brother Alphonse.

80
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,540
Alphonse Elric.

81
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,880
The, uh, Elric brothers?

82
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,240
State Alchemist, Hero
of the People Elric?

83
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,000
Yep.

84
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,689
What was that about?

85
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,300
Shut up.

86
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:18,280
The real Elric brothers are already
working to save our town up there with Mugear.

87
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:21,120
Come back when you're ready
to tell us who you really are.

88
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,100
Now why would somebody go
around using our names?

89
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,940
Brother, are you really
going to sneak in there?

90
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,840
Of course we are.

91
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,660
To confront these imposters.

92
00:06:55,661 --> 00:06:58,360
And get them to tell us all
about the Philosopher's Stone.

93
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:12,714
Brother was that?

94
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,688
A transmutation.

95
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,820
Look at this.

96
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,320
All these books are about
the Philosopher's Stone.

97
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,945
Then this must be where
they're making it, right?

98
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,360
No doubt about it.

99
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,440
In case the guards weren't
a clue, this place is off limits.

100
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,740
By any chance, are you guys
the ones... Stealing our names?

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,060
I take it that means you
are the real Ed, in the suit.

102
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:41,620
Me?

103
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,240
No you don't!

104
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,160
I'm Ed, not him!

105
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,731
Why does everybody
always think that?

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,149
Huh?

107
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,180
So you're the older brother?

108
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,020
Damn right!

109
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,480
Try to tone it down a notch.

110
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,060
Or the gunmen will
realize you're here.

111
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,600
How bizarre.

112
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:00,020
The real younger brother wears
a suit of armor to protect himself.

113
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,020
It's hard to believe
you're only fourteen.

114
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,380
How do you know
so much about us?

115
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,020
You want to start
something with me?

116
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,880
No, I don't want to
fight with you, Ed.

117
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,700
So why don't you turn
around and go home.

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:15,360
And leave us to take
care of things around here.

119
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,920
That's not the way you beg
someone to do something.

120
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,658
On your knees!

121
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,460
I said get down on the ground!

122
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:24,860
What?

123
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
So we can see eye to eye?

124
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,020
Surely you must be used to
people looking down on you.

125
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,060
An auto-mail arm, huh?

126
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,360
I guess the real Ed's
seen some action too.

127
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,140
And I'm glad to see
you have some skills.

128
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,844
I'd hate for you to be
damaging my name!

129
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,459
You know I've always wanted to find out
what a bonafide state alchemist is capable of.

130
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,966
And I think you're going
to be sorry you asked.

131
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,020
Not bad!

132
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,355
You don't need a circle, huh?

133
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,960
The fakie doesn't
need a circle either!

134
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,680
How did you... you have
a philosopher's stone?

135
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,090
What was all that commotion?

136
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:28,130
It came from in here.

137
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,700
Damn it.

138
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,340
I feel sore all over.

139
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,620
The fakie was
pretty powerful, huh?

140
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,220
Heh.

141
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:41,914
He had something
giving him a boost.

142
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,160
Does that mean they've finished
making a philosopher's stone?

143
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,860
I don't know, but
we're going to find out.

144
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,880
You know, I wonder what
those brothers' real names are.

145
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,440
Or if they're even
really brothers at all.

146
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,980
And I wonder if the older brother's
actually much older than you are, or...

147
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,560
Size doesn't mean anything!

148
00:10:07,561 --> 00:10:08,140
Uh...

149
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:10,774
Brother?

150
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,714
I think we should just
give this ruse up already.

151
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:16,000
What if the real Elric
brothers turn us in?

152
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,066
Then what?

153
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,130
Don't worry.

154
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,960
Nobody around here is going
to believe anything they say.

155
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,720
So just concentrate on completing
the stone so we can split town.

156
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,300
I just hope it
works out that way.

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,757
Well, I'm not going to let Mugear take the credit
for the research Dad devoted his entire life to.

158
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,163
Don't worry.

159
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:38,066
If it comes down to that, I'll
make sure you get away safely.

160
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,520
No matter what.

161
00:10:42,019 --> 00:10:43,385
You don't get it, brother.

162
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,665
I'm not worried about myself.

163
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,140
There's a lot more
going on here than that.

164
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,330
Are you sure you should
be standing so close to it?

165
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,170
I didn't expect to see you here.

166
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:11,850
And I didn't expect
you to let those kids in.

167
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,210
But there's no need to worry.

168
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,390
My guards scared
off the Elric brothers.

169
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,924
I think we've seen
the last of them.

170
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,230
Don't bet on it.

171
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:23,690
Those boys can be frustratingly
resourceful when they want. A desirable trait.

172
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:28,830
Of course, we always knew it was only
a matter of time before the military took

173
00:11:28,831 --> 00:11:30,190
interest in your research.

174
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,250
You had your shot.

175
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:35,810
But maybe it's time you
called it quits, Mugear.

176
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:37,630
A little more time, please.

177
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:38,650
That's all I need.

178
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,370
Just give me a little more time.

179
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:43,604
I promise you I'll complete
the Philosopher's Stone.

180
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,370
Make it fast.

181
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:49,397
You know I hate
being dissatisfied.

182
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,330
It's starting to
swell up pretty good.

183
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,250
Your cold metal feels
just like an ice pack.

184
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,230
Glad I could be of some
comfort to you, brother.

185
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,630
Even in this armor.

186
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,598
Hey, you were the guy
with the lemons before, right?

187
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:19,464
If you need a place to board
up, you can come with me.

188
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,190
Thank you so
much for taking us in.

189
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:28,385
Couldn't very well let you
kids sleep outside, could I?

190
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,930
Aren't you gonna ask
us what our names are?

191
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:35,070
You're the Elric brothers,
that's what you say.

192
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:37,190
Then you believe us?

193
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:38,450
Honestly?

194
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:43,009
Not in the least, but I figure you kids must
have your own reasons for saying that you are.

195
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,610
Makes no difference to me.

196
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,170
To each their own.

197
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:51,045
So you're not into the Philosopher's
Stone like your neighbors are?

198
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:57,510
Everyone else is unable or unwilling to
forget the wealth the gold once brought them.

199
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:01,517
So Mugear's got them
wrapped around his finger.

200
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,432
Good morning, Uncle Belsio.

201
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,719
If your father finds you
here, he won't be happy.

202
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,346
Not to worry.

203
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,960
Daddy's too wrapped up in talk
about the gold mine to even notice.

204
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,140
Good morning.

205
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,080
Hey, it's the make-believe
Elric brothers.

206
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,380
That must hurt.

207
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,840
Did somebody hit you because
you were telling lies again?

208
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:33,460
I'm telling you, we're not
the impostors here, kid.

209
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,286
But I did get clocked
by one of them.

210
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Wait, you don't mean that you're the
ones who snuck into Mugear's mansion

211
00:13:38,421 --> 00:13:40,000
last night, do you pretend brothers?

212
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,280
Of course we did.

213
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,780
We can't just let those
phonies run off with our names.

214
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:47,420
Besides, it's a major crime to use
a Philosopher's Stone to make gold.

215
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,295
They're going down.

216
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,777
Brother.

217
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,624
I'm gonna see what
I can find out in town.

218
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,330
Brother.

219
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,524
Hey, big guy.

220
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:03,470
Yes?

221
00:14:03,471 --> 00:14:06,130
How would you like to run down
to the pharmacy for me today?

222
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,450
What do you need?

223
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,790
Elisa needs her medicine,
and your brother?

224
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:12,258
He could probably
use a cold compress.

225
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,792
My word, don't look now but one
of those charlatans just walked in.

226
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,390
The gall of him showing
his deceitful face in here.

227
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,270
And you just know they were the ones who
broke into Mugear's mansion last night and

228
00:14:29,271 --> 00:14:29,901
tried to Rob him.

229
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
Hey you!

230
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,160
What are you doing here?

231
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:37,540
I just need to get
some medicine.

232
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,040
Well, we don't have nothing
here to keep you from telling lies.

233
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,380
So go on and get out!

234
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,280
Great.

235
00:14:45,281 --> 00:14:47,963
Now how am I gonna
get that medicine for Elisa?

236
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,130
Uh, excuse me.

237
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,540
You!

238
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,860
I can buy that medicine
for you if you let me.

239
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,349
To make up for me
borrowing your identity.

240
00:15:01,886 --> 00:15:02,408
Here.

241
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,161
Thank you very much.

242
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:10,160
I guess both of us have older brothers
who let their tempers get the better of them.

243
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,960
Aren't you mad at us?

244
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,630
I figure you have
your own reasons.

245
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,300
I'm sorry.

246
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,087
For us to work with Mugear,
we had to have some credibility.

247
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:26,020
The only way my brother could pass for a
state alchemist as a teenager was to claim

248
00:15:26,021 --> 00:15:27,620
he was the famous Edward Elric.

249
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:31,131
You want a philosopher's
stone that badly?

250
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:36,278
My father... He devoted his
entire life to working on the stone.

251
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,600
So, your father was
an alchemist too?

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:41,400
Mm-hmm.

253
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,053
But then one day, he
was suddenly gone.

254
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:50,467
So now out of love for my dad, my
brother insists on completing his research.

255
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,456
That's the opposite
of my family.

256
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,080
Our father was also an alchemist,
but my brother hates him for it.

257
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,280
He was obsessed
with the science.

258
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,380
And our mother suffered because
of it, especially when he left her.

259
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,080
And us.

260
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,020
On our journeys, my brother and I have
met a lot more people who've suffered because

261
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,060
of alchemy too.

262
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:20,260
Listen, if your brother's doing something you
know is wrong, please, just be brave and stop him.

263
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,260
It's tough, I know.

264
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,830
But if someone else has to intervene,
it'll only hurt your brother more.

265
00:16:32,428 --> 00:16:33,039
Hey!

266
00:16:33,050 --> 00:16:36,745
Have you noticed how there are an awful
lot of people with bad coughs in this town?

267
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:37,539
Uh

268
00:16:38,838 --> 00:16:40,399
Uh, no.

269
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,530
Well, isn't this stuff
cough medicine?

270
00:16:43,723 --> 00:16:44,483
Actually...

271
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,422
Brother!

272
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,836
Sorry, I have to go now.

273
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,410
Wait!

274
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,570
Tell me your real name!

275
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:58,883
It's Fletcher.

276
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:05,533
Brother?

277
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,601
Why are you running?

278
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,500
That imposter is
around here somewhere.

279
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,760
Have you seen him?

280
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,200
Um, no.

281
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,180
That unethical jerk.

282
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:20,080
Did you know he's been fixing people's
tools and transmuting wheels all over town?

283
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,740
That's better than him using
your name to do bad stuff.

284
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,778
That's not the point!

285
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,740
It's the way he works!

286
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,549
He's got no regard for the
law of equivalent exchange!

287
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,540
Al, we're gonna sneak into
the mansion again tonight.

288
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:33,180
What?

289
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,640
Just one day later?

290
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,400
Right!

291
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,700
They won't expect us.

292
00:17:39,739 --> 00:17:42,940
Brother, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

293
00:18:07,746 --> 00:18:09,917
Tonight we're trying
Operation Molehole.

294
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,640
Molehole?

295
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,240
By my calculations, we should be
under the center of the mansion now.

296
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,213
Are you sure?

297
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,293
No, but we gotta
come out somewhere.

298
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,033
We're in!

299
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,960
What is this?

300
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,320
So that's their plan.

301
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,700
I think this is the chemical
used to produce the redstone.

302
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,380
What redstone?

303
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,280
I remember reading something
about it at the library in Central.

304
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:50,200
It's a theoretical solid pumped
full of alchemic catalysts.

305
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:54,980
You put this refined red water under a
few megatons of pressure till it turns to stone.

306
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,500
A philosopher's stone?

307
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,520
No, more like a cheap imitation.

308
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:04,180
I think there was some alchemist named Nash
or something who was researching the redstone.

309
00:19:04,181 --> 00:19:06,280
But in the end, it
never panned out.

310
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:07,540
Brother!

311
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,340
I'm having some
trouble breathing!

312
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,360
Brother!

313
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,540
Brother!

314
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,920
This way!

315
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,560
Who's there?

316
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,720
It's me, come on!

317
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,480
Hurry!

318
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,240
Fletcher.

319
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:29,390
Brother, are you alright?

320
00:19:32,473 --> 00:19:34,358
Where am I, Al?

321
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,838
And what the hell
is he doing here?

322
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:39,413
I... I'm sorry.

323
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,920
What are you sorry about?

324
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,620
What'd you do?

325
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,120
No, Fletcher.

326
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,300
It's what you
didn't do, isn't it?

327
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,420
If you know something, tell us.

328
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,440
I get the feeling you don't
like what's going on here.

329
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:53,213
That red water you saw?

330
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:56,507
It's a toxic substance that's
been polluting the whole town.

331
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,691
But it's... it's the vital ingredient
for creating a redstone.

332
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,651
Is that why the people in Xenotime
have been coughing so badly?

333
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,140
I'm... so sorry.

334
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:13,911
Okay, this is ridiculous.

335
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,180
First things first,
let's demolish this lab.

336
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,740
I can't let you do that.

337
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:22,860
After all the work we put into
it, we finally created a redstone.

338
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,800
My father gave everything he had in
pursuit of this breakthrough, Mr. Elric.

339
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
If you think I'm going to give
up now, you're quite mistaken.

340
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,380
So you care that much about a
lame piece of costume jewelry?

341
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,263
Yeah, a fake sword
from a fake stone, huh?

342
00:20:41,126 --> 00:20:42,766
I think I can top that.

343
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,828
Mine's the genuine article.

344
00:21:02,510 --> 00:21:03,430
What the...

345
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:06,090
Red water straight from the tap.

346
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,490
If you're doused
with it, you're a goner.

347
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:10,770
You'll lose a lot more
than your consciousness.

348
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,216
Fine, let it rain.

349
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,284
Ed, this is crazy.

350
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:20,470
Your brother's right.

351
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:21,931
Just go and you can live.

352
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:22,890
Never.

353
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:26,750
I'm not giving up to some
naive kid who's desperate to be.

354
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:28,314
Just like Daddy.

355
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:33,690
Ah!

356
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,080
Fletcher!

357
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,060
Fletcher, hang in there.

358
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,260
Brother, the reason Dad wanted to create
a redstone was to bring happiness to people

359
00:21:58,261 --> 00:21:59,637
and make their lives better.

360
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:04,120
But what we've been doing here, it's
actually been making people suffer, hasn't it?

361
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,840
Don't you see the cost
of forging that stone?

362
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,001
It doesn't matter who
gets the credit anymore.

363
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:17,694
Because this isn't... Because Dad would
be ashamed if he could see what we've done.

364
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:40,290
Full metal alchemist!

365
00:23:40,777 --> 00:23:44,377
The Other Brothers Elric Part 2.

366
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:48,190
There's more to being me
than just using my name.

367
00:23:48,450 --> 00:23:50,586
Can you handle the consequences?
