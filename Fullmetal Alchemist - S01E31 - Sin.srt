1
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,876
This group of Ishbalans,
they're just refugees, right?

2
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:31,425
They haven't done anything.

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,836
If Scar is there with them, then
they're guilty of harboring a fugitive.

4
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:35,725
That's treason.

5
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:38,676
But still, don't you think we're
going a little overboard here?

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,845
You criticizing the orders
of a superior officer?

7
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:42,796
No, of course not!

8
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:43,885
I was just...

9
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,305
Our objective is to
locate and capture Scar.

10
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,464
Most likely we should have no
resistance from the Ishbalans.

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,665
But sir, what will
happen if they do resist?

12
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,445
I read a report before
we were stationed here.

13
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,405
It said some Ishbalan refugees had been
assaulted by ruffians claiming to be Military.

14
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,865
These people may
not trust us right now.

15
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,605
Those markings on your arm...

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,925
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

17
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,605
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

18
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
That is Alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

19
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,585
In those days we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

20
00:03:47,986 --> 00:03:49,366
You... Zolf J. Kimbley

21
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,535
But you should be dead.

22
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,606
Zolf Kimbley?

23
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:54,155
The Crimson Alchemist?

24
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,375
He's a State Alchemist?

25
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,175
You were supposed to
be executed years ago.

26
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:02,706
Charged with disobeying the
Military's direct orders in Ishbal.

27
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,186
Well, that's one
way of putting it.

28
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,115
Another would be that I made
women and children go boom.

29
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,135
And then when my superior
officers tried to stop me... Boom!

30
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,669
I was really looking forward to an
execution, but then for some strange reason.

31
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,526
the powers that be
decided to keep me alive.

32
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,855
But why?

33
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:21,315
I'm not sure.

34
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,255
Perhaps that gentleman there
behind you has the answer.

35
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,215
How should I know?

36
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,835
Are you just going to stand
there allowing this chaos to go on?

37
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,866
You heard him!

38
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:32,695
Arrest them!

39
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:33,726
Arrest every one of them!

40
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,195
Sir!

41
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,395
Teacher, we've...

42
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:41,255
There's no point
in trying to stop me!

43
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,115
Please, teacher, wait a minute.

44
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:49,575
Nice work, Al.

45
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,315
Amazing!

46
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,935
Definitely Homunculus.

47
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:59,575
And that means
he's coming with me.

48
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,855
Think again!

49
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,615
The girl's amazing, too!

50
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,135
An impressive transmutation.

51
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,755
However, those who would
try to harm the Führer...

52
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:21,935
Shall be defeated in the most
beautiful and graceful way!

53
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,485
You should give me more credit.

54
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,985
I'm used to dealing
with muscles like yours.

55
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,145
Only more beautiful
and graceful.

56
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,056
Brother, we've got to stop them now
before the whole building collapses!

57
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,925
This whole damn
city could collapse!

58
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,185
Brother!

59
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,825
Brother!

60
00:05:59,020 --> 00:05:59,985
My, my.

61
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,445
Don't you have
an interesting body.

62
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:10,865
He made an
explosion out of thin air!

63
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,785
I heard of something
like this once.

64
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:18,485
It's a skill that transmutes materials in
a body into a gunpowder-like substance.

65
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,665
Then it's compressed rapidly
to cause a huge explosion.

66
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,096
Why are you bothering us?

67
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,036
What do you want here?

68
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,740
We've come here for the child.

69
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:29,676
Our boss has an interest in him.

70
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,936
He'd also like to have a
word with the two of you.

71
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,865
It seems there's some
business to discuss.

72
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,065
Oh, is that so?

73
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,176
Wait a second!

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,496
You aren't trying to turn
me into a bomb, are you?

75
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,385
Oh yeah, sure.

76
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,565
Bad idea!

77
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:59,225
I'll show you what I can do!

78
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,912
I'll show you what I can do!

79
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,655
Did the Fullmetal One say your
arm and leg belonged to him?

80
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,555
Y-yes.

81
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,435
Well, maybe that explains how you were able to come
through the gate and survive all this time on your own.

82
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:23,995
Gate?

83
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:25,415
Gate!

84
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,255
I... Easy.

85
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,195
You don't have to be
alone any longer, little one.

86
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:31,575
Now, eat up.

87
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,555
Come on.

88
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,135
Yes, savor the taste
as it covers your tongue.

89
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,455
And be gracious.

90
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,135
Hundreds of human lives
went into their making.

91
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,735
Human lives?

92
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:02,995
What's wrong?

93
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,515
I thought you liked them.

94
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,286
Oh well, I guess you won't be
needing the rest of these, or my help.

95
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,406
Run along now.

96
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,815
Get caught, and give
back that arm and leg.

97
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,846
Look at that.

98
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,455
You can even perform alchemy.

99
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:29,275
It truly is awe-inspiring what a
couple of human limbs can do.

100
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,106
Listen, I was raised
on these stones of life.

101
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,575
I fancy the taste myself.

102
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,975
The reason is
because I'm not human.

103
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,555
I'm a Homunculus.

104
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:44,755
And since you're enjoying them as
well... that means you're not human either.

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,861
We need Greed's
help to handle this!

106
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:02,165
We can't do it ourselves!

107
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,405
Greed!

108
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,336
The hell with it.

109
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,125
It'd be easier if I just
blew up this entire building.

110
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,060
Hello, I'm Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Archer.

111
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:15,685
It's nice to meet the
famous Crimson Alchemist.

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,185
Yeah, you too.

113
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,525
Well, as Armstrong pointed
out, you should be dead.

114
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,445
By whose authority
were you kept alive?

115
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,156
Was it the Führer, or did Basque
Grand make that decision on his own?

116
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,165
Beats me.

117
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,885
Do you have any intention of
returning to your service in the Military?

118
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,185
I can make it happen,
if you wanted to.

119
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,396
Teacher!

120
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,036
Teacher!

121
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,096
Where are you?

122
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,613
Teacher!

123
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,605
That stupid Chimera
scratched my face pretty deep.

124
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,365
Major Armstrong!

125
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,065
Oh, the agony, the pain!

126
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,376
That woman is most
definitely your teacher.

127
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,845
Even with my elegant
attack, I was defeated.

128
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,245
Thanks for your help, Major.

129
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,405
I kinda had a feeling things
were gonna turn out like this.

130
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,345
You're holding the wrong place.

131
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:03,820
Hm.

132
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:04,785
Hm.

133
00:10:18,728 --> 00:10:20,328
I've got you my little one.

134
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:21,852
Huh.

135
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,245
Already not the same.

136
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:40,125
Go on, boy.

137
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,825
And start doing what
you were meant to do.

138
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,245
Brother, it looks
like Teacher is gone.

139
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,136
Damn it.

140
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,636
She's gonna be too weak now.

141
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,936
You escaped from
here with that kid.

142
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,068
What's she trying to do?

143
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,656
You two, go in from the right.

144
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,236
The rest of you... We're
not supposed to be here.

145
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,185
We'd better go.

146
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,445
I can hear Mustang's
smug remarks already.

147
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,206
That can't be right.

148
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,395
Verify that transmission.

149
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,446
What's our status?

150
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,855
Have we received confirmation
that the Führer is safe?

151
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:23,010
Well, sir, we contacted
headquarters in Central, and they said

152
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:25,955
that the Führer had no plans
to come south for an inspection.

153
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:26,866
Not possible.

154
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,355
I saw him with my own eyes.

155
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,715
Did you apprehend the Elric
brothers and that woman?

156
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,386
No, sir.

157
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,275
With all the personnel here, I felt
securing this crumbling building was a

158
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,740
higher priority, so I came back.

159
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,175
Major.

160
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:42,170
No.

161
00:11:42,671 --> 00:11:46,295
Wherever they go, they have
nowhere to return to besides the Military.

162
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,455
Search the premises for the
Führer again, just to be sure.

163
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,355
Sir!

164
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,406
You gotta know where she is!

165
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,230
Just tell us!

166
00:11:57,231 --> 00:11:58,735
Is Teacher okay?

167
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,295
Please!

168
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,890
We're really worried about her!

169
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:01,655
She was hurt!

170
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,426
And that kid she's
with is a Homunculus!

171
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,250
There's no telling
what he could do to her!

172
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,795
The place where the human
transmutation happened.

173
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:17,276
The same place that Izumi lost her
child, and then transmuted its body in a

174
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,275
desperate attempt
to bring it back to life.

175
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,126
How did you find out?

176
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,635
Oh!

177
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,315
I knew it.

178
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,555
I've got this feeling
that she went there.

179
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,375
She's been gone a while.

180
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,626
Teacher would pick
some place isolated.

181
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,635
Somewhere far away from any
city where no one could get hurt.

182
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,095
Yock Island.

183
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,635
That's it, isn't it?

184
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:49,975
My boy...

185
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,825
What's wrong?

186
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,285
Hurry and get it over with!

187
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:07,444
If you don't,
then I'll kill you!

188
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,225
Teacher!

189
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:20,615
Teacher!

190
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,675
Teacher!

191
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:23,615
Mrs. Izumi!

192
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:27,175
Teacher!

193
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,555
Get off her!

194
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,185
Teacher!

195
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,985
You bastard!

196
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,336
Don't touch him!

197
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,825
Leave him alone.

198
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,596
But... but we saw him!

199
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,805
He was trying to kill you!

200
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,545
I brought him out here because
I was planning on killing him.

201
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:01,265
But I... I am the one
who deserves to die.

202
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,036
What do you mean?

203
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,685
Why?

204
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,225
Because, Ed, I
created this child.

205
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,225
I used the remains of my baby and some other
elements and attempted to perform a human transmutation.

206
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,045
But what came back?

207
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,305
Well, you know what
it was, don't you?

208
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,565
Something not... not human.

209
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:25,925
Look,

210
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,245
I was once again
in front of that gate.

211
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,385
Edward, what did you see
when you looked into it?

212
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:54,360
Everything.

213
00:15:54,361 --> 00:15:57,145
Everything there is to
know about alchemy, life.

214
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,245
Everything.

215
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:02,185
I felt like all the knowledge of
the world was pouring into me.

216
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,345
The truth was in there.

217
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,025
The truth?

218
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:09,395
It looked like hell to me.

219
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,705
And I gave him to it.

220
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:13,865
That's where I left the child.

221
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,345
So then, there's no way the child you
had is the same boy that's here now.

222
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,452
When I looked at him, I
knew there wasn't any doubt.

223
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:54,921
If the child from that time had grown
up, then this is the age he would be.

224
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,731
This Homunculus appeared on Yock
Island, the same place he was born.

225
00:16:59,855 --> 00:17:02,705
It's the only explanation
they're one and the same.

226
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,856
But that still doesn't
make any sense.

227
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,025
A Homunculus is...
created from alchemy alone.

228
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,245
Created?

229
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,076
Is that what you think?

230
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,405
Do you know exactly how a
Homunculus is created, Edward?

231
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,385
Not exactly, but... but they're probably created just
like chimeras, in some place like that Laboratory Five.

232
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,676
No.

233
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,385
You're wrong.

234
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,460
Either because of love or out of foolish
curiosity, human transmutations are atempted.

235
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:34,225
And when these attempts all
backfire, a different life is created.

236
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,865
A being that has its own
body and mind, but no soul.

237
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,925
That is how the damned are born.

238
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,865
That is a Homunculus!

239
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,876
And how do you
know about all of this?

240
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,676
Who told you?

241
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,696
Envy helped me
remember where I'm from.

242
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,145
And what I am.

243
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,965
Envy?

244
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,636
You've seen that monster?

245
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,605
I have.

246
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,036
Envy was born the
exact same way.

247
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,506
So were the other
Homunculi, all thanks to...

248
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,976
idiots like you, who
decided to play God.

249
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,845
And now all we really want is
to become human ourselves.

250
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:22,675
Let's get going.

251
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,935
Well, hello, Ultimate Shield.

252
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:31,675
Hello, yourself, Ultimate... Oh, wait, you
like to be called Abomination, don't you?

253
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,570
You were sealed in a prison
for more than a century.

254
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:37,035
And you still haven't
learned your lesson, Greed?

255
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:40,146
Yes, forgive me if my
name-calling's gotten a little stale.

256
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:42,715
It's been hard to keep
my jokes current in a cell.

257
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:44,427
What did you do with the skull?

258
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,175
Why, I smashed it into
little pieces, of course.

259
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:51,135
Ah, I see, so you've taken
and hidden it somewhere.

260
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,495
Don't worry, I'll find it and put
you right back where you were.

261
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,035
Like I'd let you.

262
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,556
From the news I've been getting lately,
we've got a brand-new member around here.

263
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:09,845
He has nothing to
do with you, Greed.

264
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,225
He doesn't, but I still
want to live and be free.

265
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,185
And to make that happen,
I need a few more allies.

266
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,745
That's too bad.

267
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,176
Hello, Sloth.

268
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,145
This is Sloth?

269
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,425
You mean someone
with that name was born?

270
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,785
There's a new Lust, too, which means that the seven
of us have assembled for the first time in a long time.

271
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,565
It's a pleasure to
meet you, Greed.

272
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,145
I'm so honored to
make your acquaintance.

273
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,725
I may be greedy,
but I'm still not a fool.

274
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,125
I have no intention of fighting
two Homunculi at the same time.

275
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,025
Oh, well.

276
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,925
We'll have to deal with
them at another time.

277
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,625
Where's Wrath?

278
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,992
Oh, I imagine he should be
with the Fullmetal Boy now.

279
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:15,020
You mean you propelled him
into a confrontation with elric?

280
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,861
The plan was to use Wrath as bait
to put them back on the trail of the

281
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,839
Philosopher's Stone.

282
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,445
That'll have to wait.

283
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,785
So sorry.

284
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,745
I had to see the son of that bastard
trembling on his knees in fear.

285
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,965
I remember.

286
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,645
I can picture it all.

287
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,225
The only thing I could do was sit and
wait in the absolute darkness inside the gate.

288
00:20:39,195 --> 00:20:40,611
I just kept waiting and waiting.

289
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,865
All the while, my body
was slowly growing.

290
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,085
One day, an idiot dropped by.

291
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:51,865
He had already given his leg, and now
he stuck his arm across the threshold.

292
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,505
He was screaming and crying,
Give me back my little brother!

293
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,285
I took his limbs for myself.

294
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,325
After a long time, I was able to open
the gate with my newfound power.

295
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:09,345
And I finally came
out of the darkness.

296
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,505
This can't be.

297
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,660
Thank you for the arm and leg.

298
00:21:13,661 --> 00:21:16,945
Thank you for
this incomplete life.

299
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,965
Nothing can match my gratitude.

300
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,225
Not even my hate.

301
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,425
Now, give me your entire body!

302
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,185
Once I have that,
I'll be a real human!

303
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,685
Ow!
That hurt!

304
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,805
Your metal body's
not the one I'm after!

305
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,180
Brother, if you're not
going to do this, then I will.

306
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,320
Al, please, don't do it!

307
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,545
He's... I have to!

308
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,240
His arm and leg
are my brother's.

309
00:21:50,241 --> 00:21:52,445
The things he lost
because of me.

310
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,065
It's all my fault!

311
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,365
No Al.

312
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,825
All this time, we've been trying
to get our normal bodies back.

313
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,905
Nothing's going to stop me now!

314
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,570
Fullmetal Alchemist

315
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:43,194
Episode 32, Dante
of the Deep Forest.

316
00:23:44,618 --> 00:23:47,118
Greed, also known
as The Ultimate Shield.

317
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:50,142
What is the secret
of this Homunculus?
