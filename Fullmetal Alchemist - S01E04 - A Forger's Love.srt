1
00:00:01,823 --> 00:00:07,822
On the day we left, we burned down the
family home and all the familiar things inside.

2
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:12,402
Because some memories
aren't meant to leave traces.

3
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:17,760
Al.

4
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,300
You're okay with this, right?

5
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:20,293
Huh?

6
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,080
I mean leaving everything behind.

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,700
You don't have regrets, do you?

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,180
There's no turning back now.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:28,420
And remember, I'm the one
who insisted on coming with you.

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,808
Besides, we both know you'll
miss home more than I will.

11
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,280
Good riddance, that's what I say.

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,560
Because you know who's on his
way to becoming a State Alchemist?

13
00:00:38,046 --> 00:00:38,793
Me!

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,260
Me too!

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,360
And when I become a State Alchemist,
the first thing I'll do is fix your body.

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,480
I told you, Al.

17
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,500
That's not your burden.

18
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,025
You just have to take care of yourself.

19
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,300
I wonder how one goes about
becoming a State Alchemist.

20
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,837
Do you think we'll have to take a test?

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,500
Whatever it was, I'm happy I came.

22
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:03,688
These boys... These boys can
try human alchemy and survive.

23
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,262
I gotta tell you, their dad just
dropped a rung on my priority list.

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,683
Whatever it takes, I'm sure
Mustang will guide us through it.

25
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,920
HAHAHA What am I stressing for, Al?

26
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,179
With talent like mine,
this'll be a cakewalk for me!

27
00:01:22,993 --> 00:01:23,513
What?

28
00:01:24,086 --> 00:01:25,779
Are you thinking about Winry?

29
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,380
There's nothing we can do.

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:34,420
Those stubborn boys made their choice.

31
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:37,411
But they'll realize a mistake
and come back home.

32
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,752
I hope so.

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,878
I really do.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,316
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

35
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,162
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,400
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

37
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:59,740
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

38
00:03:43,613 --> 00:03:47,686
Fullmetal Alchemist:
A Forger's Love

39
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
Brother, do you know what
time our next train leaves?

40
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,913
Yeah, not till tomorrow morning.

41
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,540
Let's get some shut-eye.

42
00:04:01,037 --> 00:04:01,697
AAAAAHHHHHHHH!

43
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,860
My purse!

44
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:04,460
He stole my purse!

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,130
The break's over.

46
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,940
Yep.

47
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,820
It's almost too easy.

48
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:10,520
Huh?

49
00:04:12,073 --> 00:04:13,521
Off to bed with you.

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,513
Like good little boys now.

51
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:20,850
What the...

52
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,510
I think you're the one who
crawled out of the crib too early.

53
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:29,509
Nicely done.

54
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,250
Now that was something else.

55
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,150
Your trick there wouldn't be
what they call alchemy, would it?

56
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:36,625
Yeah.

57
00:04:37,425 --> 00:04:41,811
Hmmmm. To think kids your age could
be such accomplished alchemists already.

58
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,522
Around these parts, the only
alchemist I ever get to see is old Majahal.

59
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:48,088
Majahal, huh?

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:48,848
Yep.

61
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:53,116
They say he does great things for people
with his alchemy, like you boys did.

62
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,650
He's quite well respected.

63
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,790
Where can we find him?

64
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,379
Oh, the next town over.

65
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:01,490
But you really don't want to go there
right now, boys.

66
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,256
I've heard it's become a dangerous place.

67
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,250
They say the dead have risen from their
graves and are sending the villagers to them.

68
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,450
Why are you so interested in meeting this
Majahal person, brother?

69
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,470
That name.

70
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,918
That same name kept popping up
all over those... Those old letters.

71
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,310
You mean Dad's letters?

72
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,210
Yeah.

73
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:25,990
And if I remember, he wrote about human
transmutation.

74
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,330
I figure if it's the same Majahal,
it can't hurt to pay him a visit.

75
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,510
Yeah.

76
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,790
I have a feeling this is going to be a
good trip.

77
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,090
What's wrong?

78
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,610
You seem almost happy.

79
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:38,490
Hm?

80
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,990
Well, we did snag that purse snatcher,
and then everyone was so grateful to us.

81
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,190
I guess I'm just starting to see how
alchemy has the power to make other

82
00:05:48,191 --> 00:05:49,970
people's lives a little bit better.

83
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:00,737
Are you alright, brother?

84
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,610
Yeah, I'm just peachy.

85
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,110
I love turbulent carriage rides and seats
as soft as granite.

86
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,190
It didn't bother you at all?

87
00:06:08,474 --> 00:06:09,041
Uh-uh.

88
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,130
Well, you look at that.

89
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,730
Someone's throwing a party.

90
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,360
With torches and everything.

91
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,010
But they forgot to invite us.

92
00:06:20,556 --> 00:06:23,036
That one got a little
too close to the village.

93
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,150
You aren't supposed to be here.

94
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,811
This place is off limits.

95
00:06:27,536 --> 00:06:29,356
You could get yourself killed!

96
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:32,974
In the middle of testing fireworks
for the... Yeah, we noticed that.

97
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:34,110
There for the festival.

98
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,318
I'm in charge.

99
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,536
Hey, you guys aren't
from around here, are you?

100
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,010
What is this ugly thing?

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,250
Some kind of a giant robot from the
future?

102
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:44,650
Quit it!

103
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,290
Show them how we welcome strangers.

104
00:06:59,023 --> 00:06:59,983
My back!

105
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,310
We sure showed them.

106
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,450
What's going on here?

107
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:03,077
Huh?

108
00:07:14,946 --> 00:07:17,406
You must be Majahal.

109
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,845
Such fine workmanship.

110
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,790
That's truly an impressive
spirit attachment.

111
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,323
He knows about me, brother.

112
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,596
I'd expect nothing less
from the sons of Hohenheim.

113
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,830
Apparently you've
inherited his great talent.

114
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:41,145
Now then, tell me what I
can do for you boys today.

115
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:44,810
Surely you've come here seeking
something particular, and I can't very well

116
00:07:44,811 --> 00:07:46,764
disappoint the sons of a dear friend.

117
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,376
I've read the letters you wrote to my dad.

118
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:52,903
I want to know more
about human transmutation.

119
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,410
No doubt you're aware...

120
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,990
that human alchemy is strictly forbidden
by the laws of the state.

121
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,248
Yeah, I know.

122
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,024
But I don't care!

123
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,124
I will return my brother to his body!

124
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:10,750
I think you have already seen firsthand the very
high toll of messing around with human alchemy.

125
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:15,330
I know how it feels to lose someone,
but the act of molding flesh is better

126
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,490
left to the hands of God.

127
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:21,201
Okay, if that's the way you feel, then why
were you so obsessed with it back then?

128
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:23,910
Youthful optimism.

129
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,605
Or youthful foolishness.

130
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:32,036
Hello, Mr. Majahal.

131
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:36,670
I made a batch of Rose jam and had some
extra, so I thought perhaps you might enjoy.

132
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:37,836
Of course.

133
00:08:37,876 --> 00:08:38,820
You spoil me Lebi.

134
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:40,170
You're too kind.

135
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,530
Not at all.

136
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,550
Was there something else then?

137
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,450
No.

138
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,370
I'm sorry.

139
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,030
Excuse me.

140
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,270
Well, all right.

141
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,390
Take care.

142
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,620
So, what is this festival we heard about?

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,200
Oh, yes.

144
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,140
The Requiem Festival.

145
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,380
It's when the spirits of the dead are sent
up on fireworks to be returned to heaven

146
00:09:10,381 --> 00:09:11,048
where they belong.

147
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:15,260
And what about all these rumors we heard
about the dead coming back to life as

148
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,480
murderous zombies on a bloody rampage?

149
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,560
Did that have anything to do with it?

150
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:23,240
Silly rumors of a superstitious town.

151
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,040
My, my.

152
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,700
I certainly am popular this evening,
aren't I?

153
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,033
Little brat!

154
00:09:32,626 --> 00:09:35,420
Claus, don't you have something to say to
Majahal?

155
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,633
But I don't really see why I should have
to apologize.

156
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,140
It's their stupid fault for being so weak
for boys, anyway.

157
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,000
What?

158
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:44,800
Let me at her!

159
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,820
Let me at her!

160
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,620
Oh, Claus.

161
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,400
I know your sister's death affected you.

162
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,840
But you were once such a sweet and gentle
little girl.

163
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,140
What would your late sister think if she
could see what you've turned into?

164
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,540
Shut up!

165
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,120
You don't know how I feel!

166
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:00,960
Nobody does!

167
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,520
My sister didn't just up and die.

168
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,680
She was killed by that dead girl!

169
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,580
Okay.

170
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,260
Come again?

171
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,020
Ugh!

172
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:11,760
Claus, no!

173
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,220
Wait!

174
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,660
Hey!

175
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,980
Come back here!

176
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,960
You're Alchemist?

177
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,120
And you saved me?

178
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,860
It's been nearly six months since my
sister died.

179
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:49,000
We had no idea how or why.

180
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,100
One of the villagers just found her.

181
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,860
Lying there like she was asleep.

182
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:54,280
But she wasn't asleep.

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,540
And then, on the night of her funeral...

184
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:06,810
Oh, Claus.

185
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:32,463
My father told me that she was a woman who lived
in the village a long time ago before she died.

186
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:33,730
Don't you see?

187
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,750
From there, it wasn't hard to put it
together.

188
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,750
The dead lady came back to life and killed
my sister.

189
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,090
And others, too.

190
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,070
It's all because of her.

191
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:47,170
But if you guys really are alchemists,
you can help me avenge her death.

192
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,290
I've begged Majahal to help, but he
refuses to take part.

193
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,390
What do you say?

194
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:55,770
I can see why Majahal
wouldn't consider it.

195
00:11:57,410 --> 00:12:00,270
Your theory is as logically
sound as a ghost tale.

196
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,248
Besides, I don't believe
in revenge as motivation.

197
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:08,590
You're just saying that because you're
nothing but a couple of chickens posing as

198
00:12:08,591 --> 00:12:11,810
alchemists when you're just a cowardly
pipsqueak in his walking trash can.

199
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:12,970
Pipsqueak?

200
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:14,363
Trash can?

201
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,230
Nobody calls me a pipsqueak and gets away
with it!

202
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:19,430
Not even a little girl!

203
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,106
Oh, is that so?

204
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:23,030
Gosh, I'm so terrified of the whiny little
pipsqueak.

205
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,530
Shut up and take a look at yourself!

206
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:28,531
If you're a girl like they all say,
why do you look like a paperboy?

207
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:29,970
None of your business!

208
00:12:37,113 --> 00:12:38,270
I'm not a paperboy!

209
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,430
Karin?

210
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,830
Ah yes, I remember her.

211
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:48,190
She was a florist and the exquisite beauty of
her flowers was surpassed only by her own.

212
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,250
I can't believe it's been 20 years now.

213
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,110
She had recently succeeded in
cultivating the extremely rare blue Rose.

214
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,790
Oh, the woman's smile
at the time was simply...

215
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:06,370
But then, on her way to
deliver her blue roses into town...

216
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,980
And so she fell to
her death that day.

217
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,100
She fell out of all
of our lives forever.

218
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,660
But they say this same Karin
has been terrorizing the villagers.

219
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,493
Absolutely impossible.

220
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,600
We both know the dead
don't simply come back to life.

221
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,840
And even if they could, if you knew
Karin at all, you'd know it would be

222
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:30,540
inconceivable for her to
harm anyone in life or in death.

223
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,520
Hmm... So, what do
you think, brother?

224
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:37,000
Well, I don't buy ghosts or zombies or the
living dead.

225
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,540
But supposing someone were to perform a
human transmutation, the only one around

226
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:45,700
here capable of such a thing would be
Majahal, who...

227
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,820
What was that?

228
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,900
You hear that, or am I going crazy?

229
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,599
Hear... what?

230
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,220
So, we're really gonna do this?

231
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,660
Yeah, we're gonna catch this Karin
zombie on our own.

232
00:14:02,661 --> 00:14:05,040
Because no one else is gonna do it for us.

233
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,700
Are you wussing out on me?

234
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,460
If this keeps up, someone else is gonna
get killed.

235
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:11,440
And it could be you.

236
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,280
Yeah, but what if she tries to...

237
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,100
Come on, lady.

238
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,700
Are you trying to give me an ulcer?

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,920
I'm so sorry.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,800
It was an accident.

241
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,280
So then we make our move tonight.

242
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,480
You got that?

243
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,920
Brother, wait for me!

244
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:30,960
What's with you?

245
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,140
Are you scared?

246
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,500
Of course not.

247
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,280
There aren't really any
zombies around, are there?

248
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,880
Don't be thick, Al.

249
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:42,520
If Karin is roaming these woods, it
would only be thanks to human alchemy.

250
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,560
Which is the only reason we're here.

251
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,280
Ah!

252
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,280
It worked!

253
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,220
We got her!

254
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:50,620
Huh?

255
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:53,539
Huh?

256
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,540
Ow, my back!
Again.

257
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,099
False alarm!

258
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,150
Over there!

259
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,530
You took my sister from me!

260
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:15,850
Wait!

261
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:16,470
Claus!

262
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:20,369
Ah!

263
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,018
It's that sound again.

264
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,360
Majahal is just a
two-bit alchemist after all.

265
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,440
How disappointing.

266
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,200
It weren't for you, this town
would be overrun by zombies.

267
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:02,700
I knew you'd put her in her place.

268
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,260
What are you doing, Ed?

269
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:13,280
I was right about her not being a
zombie, but she wasn't a transmute either.

270
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,040
That sound she made, it's
the same one I heard in here.

271
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,060
Majahal will be very
cross if he finds you.

272
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
He doesn't like it when
people snoop around his home.

273
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:25,840
Yeah?

274
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,040
And what do you call what you're doing?

275
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,440
Ah!

276
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Brother!

277
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,120
What's all this?

278
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,440
Brother!

279
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,820
Hey, are you alright?

280
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,800
At last, he awakens.

281
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,800
It appears you've stumbled across something
that you really shouldn't have seen, Edward.

282
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,000
Oh, you mean the so-called zombies?

283
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Yeah.

284
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,260
I saw your toys.

285
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,780
Toys?

286
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,080
They're canvases for spirit attachments.

287
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:16,220
Mannequins I've carved into exact replicas
of my beloved Corinne, onto which I bind

288
00:17:16,221 --> 00:17:18,280
the soul of any village girl I can snare.

289
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:21,860
In doing so, I've formed
living versions of my fallen love.

290
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,320
It's shocking that plan ever went awry.

291
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:28,820
It is true that souls tend to reject foreign
vessels that are unlike them in nature.

292
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,620
They usually malfunction.

293
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,920
That's why Al is so special.

294
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,150
Some of my dolls escaped, wandering free
about the village, and some of my superstitions.

295
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,960
You crazy, selfish nutcase!

296
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,380
Do you even know what you've done?

297
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,200
Why the hell did you do it?

298
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,440
For the same reason any man has
ever done anything that is visionary.

299
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,260
Corinne was the only woman I ever loved.

300
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,020
Even years after her death,
my scars refused to heal.

301
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:57,660
I committed myself to bringing her back,
using the only talent I had at my disposal.

302
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:58,940
Alchemy.

303
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,620
When my attempts at human transmutation
failed, the least I could do was create

304
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:06,300
something that resembled her beauty.

305
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,940
I did it for love.

306
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,600
So you chose body over soul.

307
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,700
Shut up!

308
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,900
You're a child.

309
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,580
What could you possibly know of love?

310
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,080
But you do know something of alchemy.

311
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,840
And now you're going to help me with
an attachment like you did for your brother.

312
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,400
Yeah, right.

313
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,720
It figures.

314
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:29,900
You're just as stubborn, if not
more so, than your father was.

315
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,340
Huh?

316
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,180
I just wanted to thank you for earlier.

317
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,120
You foolish girl.

318
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,700
Run, Claude!

319
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,260
It's gone too far.

320
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
I can't turn a blind eye any longer.

321
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,820
Then you should try turning
the other cheek, wench!

322
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,780
Do something, Al!

323
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,580
Just a little more.

324
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:05,310
The rare blue Rose.

325
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:10,030
Little soul, accept your new vessel.

326
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,530
Wherever you are, Corrine, bless us.

327
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,670
Let her become just like you.

328
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:15,490
No!

329
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:16,790
Let me go!

330
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,440
Let her go, Majahal.

331
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,740
Nothing you think you know is the truth.

332
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,680
And what you've been seeking
all along is under your nose.

333
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,980
What is this nonsense?

334
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,880
I'm trying to tell you
that Corrine never died.

335
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,532
The day of the accident, she hit her head, lost
her memory, and started a new life somewhere.

336
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,660
Twenty years later, her
memory returned in a flash.

337
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:44,240
And in a true gesture of love,
she came straight back to you.

338
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,160
But you were too blinded by
obsession to see it was her.

339
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,170
Yes, Majahal.

340
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:55,730
It can't.

341
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:58,650
Are you telling me this wrinkled old woman
is Corrine?

342
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,330
Corrine was a woman of
incomparable beauty and perfection.

343
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:04,410
Just like a Rose.

344
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,750
Exactly like a Rose.

345
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:08,500
You're right there, Majahal.

346
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:12,070
But despite what you've become,
Corrine's feelings for you have not.

347
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,450
Silence, child.

348
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,910
Say one more word...
and you're dead!

349
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,830
Majahal...

350
00:20:50,635 --> 00:20:51,281
Majahal...

351
00:20:51,470 --> 00:20:53,310
I... don't see it.

352
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:57,290
There's just no way you
could possibly be my Corrine.

353
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:03,210
Corrine... I'm coming for you.

354
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:31,900
Good to see you're
depressed and back to normal.

355
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,220
Huh?

356
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,180
I'm sorry.

357
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,180
I was just thinking how alchemy
has the power to delude people, too.

358
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,420
Yeah.

359
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:42,580
Guess it does.

360
00:21:51,974 --> 00:21:52,994
Hey!

361
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:58,280
I'm sorry about everything I did and said.

362
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,640
You guys really are terrific alchemists.

363
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:03,740
Uh, yeah, we are.

364
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,060
But who are you?

365
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,460
Call me crazy, Ed.

366
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,600
But I think that's Claus

367
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,360
Huh?

368
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,260
Will you boys grow up?

369
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:23,116
You're definitely much prettier
when you don't dress like a paperboy!

370
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,860
Full Metal Alchemist.

371
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,703
Episode 5.

372
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,036
The Man with the Mechanical Arm.

373
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:48,100
Rather than give him power, his
arm seems to have power over him.

374
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,100
He says we're one and the same.

375
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,120
Are we?
