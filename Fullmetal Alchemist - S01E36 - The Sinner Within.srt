1
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:07,730
I've never seen
an Ishbalan before.

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,226
I wonder what they're
doing in a place like this.

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,750
Looks like the state military
is escorting them somewhere.

4
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:17,890
This is taking forever.

5
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:21,510
Yeah, seems to be a real
problem with the water supply.

6
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:24,010
Hey, what the hell
happened here?

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,770
That should delay
the train for a while.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:32,730
I can't believe our good luck stumbling
across these Ishbalans halfway through our trip.

9
00:00:32,731 --> 00:00:35,810
Tell me, what'd you guys
do to get thrown in here?

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,110
We're innocent, okay?

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,470
Some troops took us by surprise
and packed us in here for no reason.

12
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:41,510
That's awful.

13
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,850
The way that the state treats you is dead
wrong, but you still should have seen this coming.

14
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,450
If you leave the camps,
they're gonna round you up.

15
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,139
Listen, we could really
use your people's help.

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,750
Scar told us a Philosopher's
Stone was made in Ishbal ages ago.

17
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,690
We're looking for someone
to fill us in on more details.

18
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:01,170
You guys were pretty
close to Scar, weren't you?

19
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,950
We aren't friends to
people like that guy.

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:06,670
You won't be getting
any information out of us.

21
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,150
None of us can help you.

22
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,390
But there's an elderly man living on the outskirts
of Kishua who probably has the answers you seek.

23
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,670
But... but Chief... These two young
men will take you to meet with him.

24
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,670
I don't want to go
to that place again!

25
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,110
Don't worry.

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,316
Look, we don't make
very good chaperones.

27
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,806
We have to exchange
something for the information.

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,310
We'll give these
kids their freedom.

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,770
Equivalent trade.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,770
Though it's not one of our people's
philosophies, I admire its attempted balance.

31
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,170
We'll go, Chief.

32
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:41,615
Maybe I could give you
guys some heat relief, too.

33
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,820
Get those people off the train!

34
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:48,840
It's not safe in there!

35
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,820
Let's go.

36
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,090
Sorry.

37
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,650
Hey!

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:06,890
What are you doing?

39
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,730
Hey guys!

40
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:10,510
Need a ride?

41
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,670
Where'd you get that?

42
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,670
Did you steal it?

43
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,330
Of course I didn't!

44
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:16,050
They said I could
have it if I fixed it.

45
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,168
But I don't think they knew
they were dealing with me.

46
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,330
What the hell?

47
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,570
Let's get moving.

48
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:36,230
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

49
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,910
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

50
00:02:40,510 --> 00:02:43,430
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

51
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:49,910
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

52
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,600
Next stop, Kishua.

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,340
Straight ahead.

54
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,020
This is too easy.

55
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,226
She was great,
wasn't she, brother?

56
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,980
I need to know, Winry.

57
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,020
How much longer do
you plan on tagging along?

58
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,540
If it weren't for me,
you'd be captured now.

59
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,680
I had it under control!

60
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,480
That's not the point.

61
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,888
I don't want you
out here with us.

62
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,680
Then who would
fix up your Automail?

63
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,280
You break it about once a week.

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,420
I don't want you
here either, Winry.

65
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,860
We may have to
do some bad things.

66
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:58,101
I wanted to rip Ed's limbs
right off that Homunculus boy.

67
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:00,440
But I couldn't do
it in front of you.

68
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,734
Oh please, you wouldn't
have done it anyway.

69
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,380
I agree, Al couldn't do that.

70
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,940
But then, he doesn't need to.

71
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,760
Because I can and will.

72
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:16,520
Brother... I met someone one time, who thought
it was easy for humans to kill after they did it once.

73
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
Maybe it was inevitable,
but I did cross that line.

74
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,980
I killed an Alchemist
named Majhal.

75
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,880
That was an accident, brother.

76
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,620
You know it.

77
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,080
You were trying to save him.

78
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,600
But then at Lab Five, I came so
close to killing all those prisoners.

79
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,900
When it met a chance to return Al to his
body, their lives seemed like nothing to me.

80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,180
But you couldn't
bring yourself to do it.

81
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
And now I'll face Scar.

82
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:50,740
And if he insists on holding me down,
the way that Greed did, I'll have to.

83
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,500
Cool.

84
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,920
You'll really kill him?

85
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,496
What are you saying?

86
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,600
He's a traitor.

87
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,060
It's okay to kill those guys.

88
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,940
Enough of this talk about death.

89
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:03,812
I've heard enough.

90
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:06,240
We need to keep
our heads about us.

91
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,460
Winry!

92
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,840
Still think I'm scared
of a little danger?

93
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,520
It looks like a
battlefield, doesn't it?

94
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,220
We've never seen a battle.

95
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,132
How would we know?

96
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,420
We have, both of us.

97
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:38,660
It's just like that day...

98
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,460
when Mom died.

99
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:45,320
The state military
surrounded our entire town.

100
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,360
We didn't do anything
wrong, but they didn't care.

101
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,640
They just started shooting!

102
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,700
Mom!

103
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,020
Rick!

104
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:57,020
Mom!

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,980
Rick, stop it!

106
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,680
It's over now.

107
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,910
What's the matter?

108
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:18,330
I don't want to go.

109
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:19,478
I've seen it all before.

110
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:22,470
Fine.

111
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,150
Stay here.

112
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,010
Winry?

113
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,910
Pardon the intrusion.

114
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:33,030
Brother.

115
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,740
That marking... It's the same
as the tattoo on Scar's arm.

116
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,120
It was in the basement
of Laboratory Five, too.

117
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,680
All right, you two.

118
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,100
Come out peacefully.

119
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,760
What do you think you're doing?

120
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,920
You could have killed us!

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
You think missing
was an accident?

122
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,160
Well, if you knew it was us, why
did you shoot in the first place?

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,560
That shot was for the
bruise you gave Fury.

124
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,130
They'll be all right.

125
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,770
They know them.

126
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,150
Let's just wait here, okay?

127
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:13,370
Where's the Colonel?

128
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:16,230
He's gone back to Central,
with Warrant Officer Falman.

129
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,710
So he leaves you guys to clean up
his mess while he runs back home.

130
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:20,350
Sounds great.

131
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,290
Is that what this is
about, then, Edward?

132
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,210
The Colonel's actions
against the Ishbalans?

133
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,886
Is that why you
attacked the train?

134
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,850
It's more complex than that.

135
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:31,030
But you don't have to
suppress them, you know?

136
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,970
They weren't planning
on starting a war.

137
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,986
They just want
somewhere safe to live.

138
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,179
Don't misunderstand.

139
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,286
There wasn't any Ishbalan casualties after the
Colonel stepped in, and they were the ones who killed first.

140
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:44,090
Yoki, a former officer,
I think you knew him.

141
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:44,910
Yoki?

142
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:47,250
You mean that
buffoon from Youswell?

143
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,506
He was serving as an informant when
somebody from their side opened fire.

144
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:54,930
The mood was tense, and
his death took it over the edge.

145
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,610
But the Colonel stepped forward,
and with a controlled display of power,

146
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,050
he made a barrier and
took away their will to fight.

147
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:11,090
Had not acted so quickly, there would
have been untold casualties on both sides.

148
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:15,850
So even a soldier can keep things
innocent every once in a while.

149
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,490
You're dogging on the Colonel
just because he's military, Ed?

150
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,290
Don't forget,
you're a soldier too.

151
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:26,190
We've decided to transfer most of the
Ishbalans to the Southern Encampments.

152
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:30,782
But first we have to find the one responsible
for Yoki's death and give a fitting punishment.

153
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,290
To that end, we're holding
several here for interrogation.

154
00:09:35,090 --> 00:09:36,630
There's an old man
with them, right?

155
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:39,270
The man you used to live in
the hut where you found us.

156
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
Security's pretty tight.

157
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,900
Do you think he's the shooter?

158
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,560
No, no.

159
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,160
The old man isn't
considered a suspect.

160
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,700
But we are protecting him.

161
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,520
From who?

162
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,960
Those are Ishbalan
prisoners, right?

163
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,660
They attacked the old man,
called him a heretic and an exile.

164
00:10:02,661 --> 00:10:05,520
Seems he's even been banned
from being with his own people.

165
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,400
I don't believe it.

166
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,580
The Ishbalans have been
treated like outcasts for so long.

167
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:14,620
Now you're saying they're even
cutting themselves off from each other?

168
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,260
Why?

169
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,460
Exiles?

170
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,140
So what kind of
people are these exiles?

171
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,660
The filthy kind.

172
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,160
They're people who've
betrayed the laws of Ishbal.

173
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,020
That's why their
faces are marked.

174
00:10:25,485 --> 00:10:26,960
So we'll all know what they are.

175
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,360
And what's their
betrayal exactly?

176
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,480
Just what did they do?

177
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,400
I guess I don't know
the exact details.

178
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah, our mom just told us
they didn't believe in Ishbala.

179
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,820
So that meant they couldn't
be with our people anymore.

180
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,800
But I can't believe he's
considered an exile, too.

181
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,200
Who is that?

182
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,940
The man you call Scar.

183
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,340
And he is one, okay?

184
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,640
He's a dirty traitor.

185
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,240
Can you tell me what
your mom was like?

186
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,620
She was the nicest mom ever.

187
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,921
And even though she couldn't see, she gave
all her time to help others up at the hospital.

188
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,780
Is that so?

189
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,060
The Philosopher Stone?

190
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:18,376
You know you're the third
person to ask me about that.

191
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,220
Really?

192
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,320
There was a
scarred man recently.

193
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,940
And many years ago the man's brother
came to me wanting to learn all about the stone.

194
00:11:25,941 --> 00:11:26,800
I see.

195
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,560
And he was an Alchemist.

196
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,380
Then does that mean Scar's brother is the
one who created the Philosopher's Stone?

197
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,080
No, he didn't create it.

198
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,960
That young man was
far too gentle for the work.

199
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,880
But how do you know so much
about the Philosopher's Stone?

200
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,580
Aren't you an Ishbalan?

201
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:45,540
Yes.

202
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,180
But I am an exile.

203
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,980
Because I learned
the Grand Arcanum.

204
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,520
The Grand Arcanum?

205
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,022
What's that?

206
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,180
The great knowledge passed down through the
Ishbalan people in whispers and sacred rooms.

207
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,800
Through it, Ishbal prospered.

208
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,080
But the tides of
culture changed.

209
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,275
And it was labeled blasphemy.

210
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,420
Sealed.

211
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,520
And hidden away.

212
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:15,560
After that, those who practiced the art were exiled,
never allowed to return to the land in which they were born.

213
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:21,260
The Grand Arcanum gave us the power to
transform anything in the world to our own design.

214
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,480
And so it was declared to be an act
against God and it was made forbidden.

215
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,180
The Grand Arcanum is... Alchemy?

216
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,400
That can't be.

217
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,095
It's impossible.

218
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,700
You don't believe the Ishbalans.

219
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:37,460
Having no industrialized society and
living in the middle of the desert could.

220
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,556
possess such a
knowledge as Alchemy.

221
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,040
Is that what you think?

222
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,220
Well, you wouldn't be the first one to see
different eyes and skin and turn yourself away.

223
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:52,960
Who could possibly believe this other world
could have the same depth and spirit as you?

224
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:57,060
Then could you teach us too?

225
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,660
Your method of making
a Philosopher's Stone?

226
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,220
Yes, I could.

227
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,340
But I'm afraid there's very little
difference in theory between the Grand

228
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:09,140
Arcanum and your people's
method you've no doubt discovered.

229
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,067
The only variance is the
number of sacrifices required.

230
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,640
Number of sacrifices?

231
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:20,740
A fallen city or an entire
tribe lost to genocide.

232
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,720
Atrocities of war so horrific
all that remain are the graves.

233
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,780
Tens of thousands or hundreds
of thousands of misplaced souls.

234
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,380
In the hands of a skilled Alchemist
these lost souls are brought together,

235
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:39,380
forged into the
Philosopher's Stone.

236
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,360
Then you were right.

237
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,900
The theory is the same just
to a more gruesome degree.

238
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:47,400
It's hardly the answer
we're looking for.

239
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,900
Well, can you tell
us where Scar is?

240
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:53,480
He said he was on his
way to create a stone.

241
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,460
Why would you tell
my brother that heresy?

242
00:13:58,305 --> 00:13:59,320
He was desperate.

243
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,788
He just wanted to bring
back the woman he loved.

244
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,420
But you told him all of Ishbal
would have to die for that to happen.

245
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,300
Then the war came and my brother
blamed himself like he'd brought it all upon us.

246
00:14:12,225 --> 00:14:13,520
For all I know, he did.

247
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,120
He's in here!

248
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:17,780
Look!

249
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,640
Don't do it!

250
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:29,618
You make it!

251
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,080
The horrors keep repeating.

252
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,420
Will the Ishbalan people never receive
the peace that they were promised?

253
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:43,380
Unless I forge a power
greater than the Military's.

254
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,940
The Philosopher's Stone.

255
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,920
So, then will you
too become an exile?

256
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,640
I'm already an exile, old man.

257
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,640
The lives of tens of thousands
of people lie trapped in this arm.

258
00:14:59,180 --> 00:14:59,526
An exile?

259
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,100
You can't be.

260
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,200
You can't!

261
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:11,320
Even in the darkest of
suffering, a man can sleep.

262
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,780
But for the man who inflicts the
suffering, his mind cannot rest.

263
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:15,400
Ever.

264
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,980
Then from this day forth,
I'll never sleep again.

265
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,960
Don't let us see your face
again, you stinking exile!

266
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,720
Really?

267
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,040
Are you sure they
were the Rockbells?

268
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:37,403
We're sure.

269
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:42,070
The lady doctor was really scary when she was
mad, but she gave us treats and stuff all the time.

270
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,840
They helped all the wounded the same,
whether they were Ishbalans or soldiers.

271
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,920
Mom was so sad when
she told us they'd been killed.

272
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,980
You're telling me it was really a
state Alchemist who killed them?

273
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,260
Yeah, I heard it was an
Alchemist whose power was fire.

274
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,560
And somebody praised
him for what he did.

275
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,340
Mom was crying a lot.

276
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,360
What's wrong?

277
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,880
That's weird.

278
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,100
The flesh around the
wound isn't burned at all.

279
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,040
You're right.

280
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,640
And the exit wounds for most projectiles
are larger than the entrance wounds.

281
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,460
Not here.

282
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,600
You know what I'm
thinking, brother?

283
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,767
There's a lieutenant colonel named
Archer you might want to talk to.

284
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,100
He's been after a Homunculus.

285
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,240
A Homunculus?

286
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,960
Their bodies are fluid.

287
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,280
One can turn her fingers into
daggers in the blink of an eye.

288
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,620
They can make those wounds.

289
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,819
Go tell Lieutenant Colonel Archer and
Major Armstrong to redirect their investigation.

290
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:39,720
This wasn't done by an Ishbalan.

291
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,200
Well, I suppose I can't take the opinions
of a famous State Alchemist lightly, can I?

292
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,340
Stop struggling!

293
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,580
Huh?

294
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,220
Uh, Winry?

295
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,700
Rick, Leo, listen to me.

296
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,780
I've managed to get
you guys acquitted.

297
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,320
You're no longer in any trouble and the rest of
your people will be released from this station too.

298
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,460
But they're still going to
send you back to the camps.

299
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:08,186
If you two want, you
can go live in Resembool.

300
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,064
I got permission.

301
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,300
No thanks.

302
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,020
We'll go to the
camp with the others.

303
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,060
Your call.

304
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,120
And where are you off to now?

305
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,180
We're going after Scar.

306
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:21,660
If we don't, something
really bad will happen.

307
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,680
Will you kill him?

308
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,640
Why would I?

309
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:28,980
Because he's an exile, a
filthy traitor and he deserves it!

310
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,016
We'll make sure he doesn't
cause any more damage.

311
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,640
But because we're both Alchemists,
or no, because we're both human,

312
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,380
I don't want to kill
him or anybody else.

313
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,400
I've decided that.

314
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,460
Don't feed me that!

315
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,300
I know you all hate Ishbalans!

316
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,000
Are you scared?

317
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:01,400
Why should I be?

318
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,060
Well, there's something
that's had me afraid.

319
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,820
Your red eyes.

320
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,820
The first time I saw Scar on those
library steps, I was scared of him.

321
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,880
He was the first
Ishbalan I'd ever seen.

322
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,860
But now, well, I've learned that you
can't always trust the way that you feel.

323
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,120
And you can't trust everything you've
heard about people like me either.

324
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:23,600
From your mom and your dad.

325
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,380
Because even they can be wrong.

326
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,440
That's why we've all got
to find our own answers.

327
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,260
Slowly.

328
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,360
Over time.

329
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,720
So what about you, Winry?

330
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,040
Where are you headed now?

331
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm going back to Central.

332
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,725
And if it's alright with Lieutenant Hawkeye,
I'd like to go back with her to see Mr.

333
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,146
and Mrs. Hughes and Elicia.

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,280
Right.

335
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,920
Winry, when did you decide this?

336
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:01,270
Let's see.

337
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:03,050
Guess we'll try Ishbal first.

338
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,986
I hope Scar hasn't created
his Philosopher's Stone yet.

339
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,370
Yeah, feels strange to say that.

340
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,650
Since the stone's
what we're looking for.

341
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,870
Guess this is the ignition.

342
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:27,270
Lieutenant?

343
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,670
You can call me Riza.

344
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,570
I was just wondering, have
you ever shot anyone before?

345
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:35,750
When I had to.

346
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:37,190
To keep the peace.

347
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:39,230
Did you know a pair of doctors?

348
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,610
The Rockbells?

349
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:41,350
Yes.

350
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:47,310
I don't know what you've been told, but
there are times when a soldier has to take a life.

351
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:49,770
Even when he doesn't
understand why.

352
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,430
The orders may not even
make any sense at all.

353
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,890
That's the way it is when you're a soldier,
and it can be a stupid and terrible life.

354
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,150
If you hate it, why
don't you get out?

355
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,670
Because there's
someone I have to protect.

356
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:06,110
And it's not a burden
someone forced on me.

357
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:11,410
It's a decision I made for myself, and I
take full responsibility any time I fire a round.

358
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,130
But he's the reason
I squeeze the trigger.

359
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:18,750
And I won't ever hesitate to do it
until the day he accomplishes his goal.

360
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,850
But how can you be certain?

361
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:22,290
What if he isn't
worth protecting?

362
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,810
That's another call I
have to make for myself.

363
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:30,910
This is WWrath.

364
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:32,270
Our number seven.

365
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,370
Wrath, ooh!

366
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,330
Pleased to meet you, Wrath.

367
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,730
I want you to go after
Fullmetal and his brother again.

368
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,050
Affect them.

369
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:43,350
I thought you said we
shouldn't count on them.

370
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:45,670
That they didn't have the
constitution to make a stone.

371
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,630
And yet they are headed
to Ishbal as we speak.

372
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:49,570
Really?

373
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:55,870
If they discover what really happened there, any chance we
do have of them creating a stone will permanently dissolve.

374
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,510
Not to mention the blow to
our mobility if the truth got out.

375
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,090
Then... can I eat them?

376
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:04,330
Perhaps.

377
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,130
If worse comes to worse, we might
just need to get rid of them altogether.

378
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,130
I'm sorry.

379
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,970
I had no idea all
this had happened.

380
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,170
I will push him to the top.

381
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,110
That's what he would always say.

382
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:33,470
That he would support Roy
Mustang until he became the Führer.

383
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,990
Is that so?

384
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:39,150
He really seemed
happy to help his friend.

385
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:49,700
It can't... It can't be...

386
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,937
Fullmetal Alchemist

387
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:47,990
EPISODE 37 The Flame Alchemist, The Bachelor
Lieutenant, and the Mystery of Warehouse 13

388
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,330
What's the Colonel up to.
