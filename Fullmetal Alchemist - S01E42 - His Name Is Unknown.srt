1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,240
What's going on?

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,200
I feel strange.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:07,040
My body...

4
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,200
You bastard!

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:14,680
My work is so intricate, only an
explosives artist like myself can defuse it.

6
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,280
But you'll have to find somebody
else, because I'm about to retire.

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,380
No need to hurry.

8
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:24,580
You still have
plenty of time left.

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:31,240
I've made his armor react slowly with the oxygen in
the air, gradually spreading until he's completely black.

10
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:37,240
I want him to have time to think about his death
and reflect on how meaningless his efforts have been.

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,000
No!

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,360
It has to be a lie!

13
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:45,320
My body!

14
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm scared.

15
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,420
Stay still, Alphonse Elric.

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,080
I'm not sure what's happening with your
body, but we don't want to make it any worse.

17
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,840
Just try not to exert yourself.

18
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,800
I wouldn't touch him if I
were you, scarred man.

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:06,500
Homunculus.

20
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,040
Just leave us alone.

21
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,580
That arm's only good for
destroying things, not remaking them.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,880
Now, if Edward were here, he'd be able
to transmute his brother into some other

23
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,180
substance, disrupting Kimbley's
alchemy and stopping this bomb.

24
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,500
You think that would work?

25
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,220
Altering his composition?

26
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,880
Leave him.

27
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,740
He's a lost cause.

28
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:32,460
Miles, you have to think of yourself now
and your own goal of forging the Stone.

29
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:35,160
Just as I thought.

30
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,260
You aren't my brother's love.

31
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,860
The woman I knew would never
have acted so heartless and cold.

32
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,540
Stop it!

33
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,840
Shut up!

34
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,100
Shut that thing up!

35
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:42,455
Ed...

36
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,060
Get up Ed!

37
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,480
Get up!

38
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,640
And move forward!

39
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:03,546
Go Rose!

40
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,570
Get out of here!

41
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:07,530
Get off me!

42
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,210
Get off!

43
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,330
Damn it!

44
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,250
I'm not gonna sit back and let you
keep using my right arm for your alchemy!

45
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,150
It's mine now!

46
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,360
Now now, that's enough, Ed.

47
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,080
Come here.

48
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,440
Give Mom a hug,
my Prince of Cool.

49
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,580
No, Ed!

50
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,060
Don't do it!

51
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,380
It's been haunting
me for a while now.

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,900
Your appearance.

53
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,680
So much like her.

54
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:54,980
Still, I tried as hard as I
could not to think about it.

55
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
Not to face the truth.

56
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,420
What we made... on that night...

57
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,700
We created you.

58
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,240
Hmph.

59
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:08,640
Ed!

60
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,760
So it's true what you are.

61
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,780
Our sin and our burden to bear!

62
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,700
Clearly, you're with them.

63
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,040
Okay, so we know you've
been working in the Military.

64
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:35,920
But why?

65
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:36,940
What's the point?

66
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,920
Don't touch her!

67
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,300
I'll kill you!

68
00:05:54,931 --> 00:05:55,366
Come on, Rose.

69
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:55,810
Let's go.

70
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,560
It takes more than that to end the
life of a Homunculus for good, Ed.

71
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,620
You'll never defeat them if
that's the best you can do.

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,100
Isn't it great, Rose?

73
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,000
Your voice!

74
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,320
It's finally back!

75
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,340
I guess so.

76
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,040
Thank you.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,820
And thank you for telling
me what I needed to hear.

78
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:23,920
And...

79
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,800
for your baby's cry.

80
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,280
I haven't heard anything
from Kimbley yet.

81
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,620
Or from your chimeras,
for that matter.

82
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,186
They're under the
Führer's command.

83
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,800
I don't know why
there'd be a problem.

84
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,140
Well, obviously there is.

85
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,100
If there's not a problem,
then why aren't they back yet?

86
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,220
How long does it take
to find a kid's corpse?

87
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,700
Have Scar and Kimbley
killed each other in battle?

88
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,580
Or is the Crimson Alchemist
just out having too much fun?

89
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,260
There's no time for this!

90
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:00,240
So this is your little
command center, huh?

91
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:01,540
Cozy.

92
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,040
If I'd known you were coming,
I would have cleaned up.

93
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,340
You hands are...

94
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,610
What is that thing?

95
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,510
There's no need to be cruel.

96
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,950
Lieutenant, calm down.

97
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:19,870
He's no threat.

98
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,870
No, just a pity.

99
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,250
His name is Shou Tucker, called the Sewing
Life Alchemist back when he was a human.

100
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:27,350
Hello, Major.

101
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:28,370
Huh.

102
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:32,410
I take it you've had a sudden change
of heart and won't be helping me now.

103
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,450
I've never been on
your side, Archer.

104
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,890
I've only been playing the part.

105
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:39,530
I had to get to the bottom of the
corruption plaguing our Military.

106
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,650
And sometimes you have to
play with vermin to sniff out a rat.

107
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:47,470
You're naive if you think you can have a
useful Military without a little corruption.

108
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:51,690
Tucker!

109
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,860
What are you hoping to
accomplish with this circus act?

110
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,080
A decade ago, you annihilated Ishbal
and came back a hero of the state.

111
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,380
Now I have Lior.

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,340
It's my turn for fame.

113
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,527
Come look!
Come look!

114
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,230
Tehehehehe.

115
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,486
Death.

116
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:28,505
Death.

117
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,330
Soon they'll all be dead!

118
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,770
Not if that human wannabe can't get a grip on
her own emotions... and pull it together in time.

119
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,300
We'll see.

120
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,360
I suppose her musings are fine
as long as she takes care of Scar...

121
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:49,420
and makes sure that he too
becomes an ingredient in the Stone.

122
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,300
The Philosopher's Stone?

123
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,680
We still get one?

124
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,560
We'll take it ourselves
after everyone else is dead.

125
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:58,820
It will be as if the Stone
never existed at all.

126
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm sorry I don't live
up to your memories.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,980
I would never have
expected you to.

128
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,660
I told you.

129
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,780
You are not the same woman
my brother tried to resurrect.

130
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,780
You just look like her.

131
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,160
But if I use the Philosopher's
Stone to be human, I'll become her.

132
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,860
No you won't.

133
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,560
How do you know?

134
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,560
Because the dead can
never come back to life.

135
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,920
What are you gonna do to him?

136
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,420
Tell me dammit!

137
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:39,220
Stay back!

138
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,020
Now just shut your
mouth and watch.

139
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,920
Now what have you done?

140
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,330
That arm...

141
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,810
was given to me by my brother.

142
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,950
He trapped the souls of
the dying Ishbalans inside it.

143
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:36,370
By turning his own body
into a transmutation circle.

144
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:40,710
He did that for good reason.

145
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,730
To create the Philosopher's
Stone within himself.

146
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,810
A gift that he passed on to you.

147
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,010
So that means...

148
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,890
I've attached the
locket to his armor.

149
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,690
That way you can't
get anywhere near him.

150
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:56,890
You can only stand
back and watch.

151
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:58,790
Have you lost your mind?

152
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,730
You wanna turn this boy
into the Philosopher's Stone?

153
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,670
Better that than a bomb.

154
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:11,890
You said that if we changed his body
into something else he wouldn't explode.

155
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,470
It was the only
way I could help.

156
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,090
And what about the actual stone?

157
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:18,750
Don't tell me you're planning to hand
it over to those boys when you're done.

158
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:21,370
I don't even know
whether or not this will work.

159
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,150
But if by some miracle it
does... the stone will be theirs.

160
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,190
They can do with
it what they want.

161
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:30,910
I'm afraid I can't
let you do that.

162
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,890
I need you to make the real
Philosopher's Stone, you understand?

163
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:37,870
Don't waste all your work, all the
work of your brother just to save that boy.

164
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,930
How is that going
to fulfill your dreams?

165
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:44,670
If you kill me where I stand right now... would
that help you make your dream come true?

166
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,180
Have it your way.

167
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,380
And if there does come a time when a
stone is made... I'll find a way to use it myself.

168
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,280
Whatever happens to that poor
boy now... it's not my responsibility.

169
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,520
Brother...

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,060
please... do something.

171
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,570
Just keep going.

172
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:23,570
The next city's not
too much farther.

173
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:24,810
We have to go now.

174
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,050
Do the best you can.

175
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:29,550
I've got to go track down Scar
wherever he is so I can turn him in.

176
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,570
You're going to hand
him over to the Military?

177
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,350
It's the only way the
people of Lior can be

178
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,485
cleared of any blame.

179
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:38,370
I have no choice.

180
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,770
Please don't do it.

181
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,930
It's not right.

182
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:42,950
But you understand
why I have to.

183
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:46,130
Equivalency, right?

184
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,550
I don't know.

185
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,230
Maybe there's
something else I can do.

186
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,135
I'm not sure what... but maybe I can figure out a
way to use what happened with the Führer's secretary.

187
00:12:57,311 --> 00:13:00,470
to possibly persuade the
Colonel to... I don't know.

188
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,490
Maybe sit down and
negotiate or something.

189
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,370
But please, don't count
on me to protect you.

190
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,430
Keep going.

191
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:14,470
Before their troops
figure out you're here.

192
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,570
The farther you get
from them now, the better.

193
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,250
Of course.

194
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:19,690
We know the stakes and have
no intention of being caught.

195
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:23,814
We'll disperse a handful of us in each
town we pass, blending in with the population.

196
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,090
They're all counting
on you now, Lyra.

197
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,210
And you.

198
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,070
Okay, Ed.

199
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:29,830
I'll see you.

200
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:30,850
Uh-huh.

201
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,055
Well no.

202
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,400
This time it's goodbye.

203
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,160
Sir, there's no sign of
anyone in there at all.

204
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,000
They must be planning
a surprise attack.

205
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,496
What's that?

206
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,260
Someone's up there!

207
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:52,648
Colonel!

208
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,700
What was that?

209
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,540
What?

210
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,500
Did he fall?

211
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,220
I don't know.

212
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,220
What was that?

213
00:13:58,221 --> 00:13:58,940
I don't know.

214
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,160
Well, they've killed
a State Alchemist.

215
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,640
I should have known
that killer was behind this.

216
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:12,000
But if he thinks he can intimidate
us by killing a State Alchemist...

217
00:14:12,001 --> 00:14:14,680
...he's about to find out
how sorely mistaken he is.

218
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:20,260
The tank division will patrol the perimeter while the
infantry charges into the heart of the city to capture Scar.

219
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:45,290
They had orders not
to move into the city.

220
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:48,050
Then this must truly
be the will of Ishbala.

221
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,500
I found him!

222
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
You fool.

223
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,720
You know it takes more
than bullets to get rid of me.

224
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,280
I couldn't control myself.

225
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,900
My damn body
has a will of its own.

226
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,960
You... you loved me, didn't you?

227
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:32,400
No, not you, but her.

228
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,160
I hated my brother so much.

229
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:45,060
He turned his back on the teachings of Ishbala to
immerse himself in the sacrilege of Alchemy instead.

230
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:49,660
And even though I knew he'd
given me his arm to save my life...

231
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,560
...still there was no room in my
hate-filled heart for forgiveness.

232
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,860
But the Elric brothers...

233
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,100
...they live only
for each other.

234
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:02,720
That's true.

235
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,900
Seeing their love
for each other...

236
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,520
...it made me long to
say those words myself.

237
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,600
Brother, I love you.

238
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:24,140
So that's why you did the same
thing for this younger brother...

239
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,840
...as your older
brother did for you.

240
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,780
Come on, let's go.

241
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,640
This life of wickedness.

242
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,860
...has one closing act.

243
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,420
Tell me.

244
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,740
What's your real name?

245
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,000
Long ago, this body did have
a holy name given by God.

246
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,340
But that person died years ago from
a life of sin, malice, and retribution.

247
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,720
There he is!

248
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,412
He's getting away!

249
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,100
After him!

250
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
Then goobye, Scar.

251
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,001
Hold on!

252
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:10,095
Wait!

253
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,760
Well, I guess you survived.

254
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,400
The people of
Lior have given up!

255
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:18,140
The only one left now is Scar.

256
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:19,340
Given up, you say?

257
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,980
I have trouble buying that.

258
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,780
Not after they've just killed
the Crimson Alchemist.

259
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,120
But you had orders
not to invade Lior!

260
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,980
I'm afraid the battle's
already begun.

261
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,360
You can pretend it's beyond your control...
...but because of your senseless warmongering...

262
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:35,296
...these soldiers are being led to slaughter
and they don't... The target's been located, sir!

263
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,700
We're engaged in combat now!

264
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:37,160
Good.

265
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,860
This is a mistake!

266
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,360
Wait, don't go!

267
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,100
You'll all die, dammit!

268
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,060
Brother...

269
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,440
The man who inflicts
suffering, can't rest.

270
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,200
His guilty mind won't allow it.

271
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,820
But today, I can finally close
my eyes to the living nightmare...

272
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,140
...and lay down, knowing
that I won't wake again.

273
00:18:15,678 --> 00:18:16,238
Brother.

274
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:44,150
What the hell is that?

275
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:48,687
Noooo!!

276
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,230
Colonel Archer!

277
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:51,910
You idiot!

278
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,200
My god, is everyone all right?

279
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,020
Somehow.

280
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,400
Has Colonel Archer's
battalion moved yet?

281
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,140
Well, they did.

282
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,500
But really, it's the
strangest thing.

283
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:23,340
All of a sudden, Lior
started glowing bright red.

284
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,640
Yeah, and they've been
out of contact ever since.

285
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,380
I thought I was dead.

286
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,700
What just happened out here?

287
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,740
Pull yourself together.

288
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,260
Gather up all the survivors.

289
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,810
Hello?

290
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:01,562
Al..

291
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,310
Brother?

292
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,190
No, brother!

293
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:09,670
You have to get away from me!

294
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,190
I'm gonna explode any minute!

295
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:15,920
Okay.

296
00:20:15,921 --> 00:20:17,180
I don't get it.

297
00:20:17,181 --> 00:20:18,258
What are you doing out here?

298
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,260
huh. Am I... I'm back to normal?

299
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,000
My body's normal again!

300
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,320
I mean, not normal
normal, but normal!

301
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,420
All right.

302
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:33,120
I don't know what you're
talking about, but... Oh, right.

303
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,780
Well, first Kimbley
turned me into a bomb.

304
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:39,634
Then Scar killed him and Lust said if my armor
was turned into something else, I could be saved.

305
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,460
So Scar put his hand on me
and it was like his arm was me.

306
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,040
And... uh... Listen,
open up your chest plate.

307
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,780
Just do it, Al.

308
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,280
Brother....
What is it?

309
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,180
Well, Al...

310
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,190
A minute ago, The
transmutation circle in Lior was activated.

311
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,060
Scar... he created a Philosopher's Stone,
but he didn't do it inside his own body.

312
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,120
Yes, that's right, boy.

313
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,440
You've finished it.

314
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:20,160
Now the very thing you've been
searching for is attached to your soul.

315
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,680
You mean I am the
Philosopher's Stone?

316
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,520
But that doesn't make any sense.

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,840
Why would Scar do that?

318
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,120
You should go.

319
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,800
It won't be long before
everyone's after you.

320
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,680
My colleagues and the state.

321
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,520
And what about you?

322
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,700
I thought you were
after the stone, too.

323
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:41,640
Oh.

324
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,020
Brother... I'm...

325
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:03,360
That's right.

326
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:39,736
Fullmetal Alchemist

327
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,380
Episode 43,
The Stray Dog.

328
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:49,160
I'm sorry, Colonel,
but this was our cause.

329
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,540
And now we have to go back.
