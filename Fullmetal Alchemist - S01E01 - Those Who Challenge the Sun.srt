1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,560
That ought to do it.

2
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,860
You ready?

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,140
Don't be scared, Al.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
Everything's perfect.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,940
Let's go for it.

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,850
Alchemy the science of
understanding the structure of matter.

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,370
Breaking it down, then reconstructing it
as something else.

8
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,590
It can even make gold from lead.

9
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,850
But alchemy is a science.

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,730
So it must follow the natural laws.

11
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,190
To create, something of equal value must
be lost.

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,230
This is the principle of equivalent
exchange.

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,263
But on that night, I
learned the value of some

14
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:23,091
things can't be measured
on a simple scale.

15

That was Edward!

17
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,460
Wait Winry, look!

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,910
My brother and I knew the laws of science.

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,230
Of equivalent exchange.

20
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,530
That gain required sacrifice.

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,090
That something had to be taken from us.

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,230
But we thought there was
nothing more we could lose.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,550
We were wrong.

24
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:50,905
No.

00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,110
Al, no!

Mom?

Is that you?

It's nothing but sand!

38

If I had some grass, I could turn it into
bread.

I'm starving!

40
00:03:04,425 --> 00:03:05,625
Eh.

Hey Al, where'd you going?

Reason number two I hate the desert.

why you keep falling in!

00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:27,530
Full of what?

51
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,569
Get back here!

52
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,630
What are you gonna do?

53
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,430
Nothing!

Stop and you'll find out!

Are you ok brother?

It's your fault for not stopping when I
said.

61
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,590
You wouldn't stop either if someone were
chasing you.

62
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,190
Shut up.

63
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,770
I'm too tired to fight.

00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,230
Wait a second.

66
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,350
I can't hear it.

Al!

68
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,090
Look!

Hey, wait!

Water, water, water, water, water,
water, water!

Guess this explains the nasty stench in
the air.

00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:40,830
What's wrong?

73
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,050
Hm?

74
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,590
Is it blood?

75
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,870
Nope.
More like blood red wine.

76
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:47,970
Hey!

00:04:47,971 --> 00:04:48,990
Get away from there!

You'll have to forgive me.

00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,270
I thought you were trying to sneak a
little nip.

Fountain stocked with free wine?

85
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,070
That's pretty ritzy.

86
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,590
This town must be loaded.

00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:04,270

Time for a little soul food.

91
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:37,850
Children of God who live upon this land,
pray in faith that ye may be saved.

92
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,338
As sun lights the day,
so does the sun god Leto

93
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:44,430
illuminate thy path, and
draw near to the sun.

94
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,450
Well, that's freakish.

95
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,610
Some kind of religious broadcast.

96
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:49,802
Your buddy's in a suit of
armor, and you're wearing

97
00:05:49,922 --> 00:05:51,730
gloves in the desert,
and you call us freaks?

98
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,571
May this town be blessed, and may we
continue to experience growth and prosperity.

99
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,310
What's your deal, anyway?

100
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,370
You street performers?

101
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,670
I don't think so, Pops.

102
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,210
Do I look like a clown to you?

103
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,330
Well, you must have some
reason to journey out this far.

104
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,190
We're just trying to track something down,
that's all.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,550
Now, who is this guy on your airwaves?

106
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,930
Why, that's Sir Cornello.

107
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,671
Ah.
Doesn't ring a bell.

108
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,750
You're kidding me!

109
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,637
You've never heard of the great prophet
Cornello?

110
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,630
What's great about him?

111
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,550
He can perform miracles, for one thing.

112
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,030
I've never seen anything like it.

113
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,768
This town was a godforsaken
dust bowl before Cornello

114
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,930
got here and transformed
it into a desert paradise.

115
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,810
Cornello can even forgive sins.

116
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,430
Yeah, we're on the sun god's
good side because of him.

117
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,550
He gives us blessings.

118
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,791
Ah.
I just remembered.

119
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,010
We have to be somewhere.

120
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,930
You ready to split?

121
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,930
Yeah.

122
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:41,930
Okay.

123
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,850
Oops.

124
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,270
Now you've done it, buddy.

125
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,770
What do you expect wearing a stupid tin
suit?

126
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,310
Don't bust a lung, Grandpa.

127
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,388
We can fix it.

128
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,730
It's in a thousand pieces!

129
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,130
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,890
Let me try.

131
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Sure.

132
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,910
That drawing.

133
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,010
What's it for?

134
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,389
You'll see in just a second.

135
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,790
It's called the transmutation circle.

136
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,490
Okay.
Here goes.

137
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,600
If you are lost, follow
me and you will be found.

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,960
It's really a land of prophets.

139
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
Your buddy can work miracles like
Cornello.

140
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,800
It's nothing like that.

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
It's science.

142
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
We're Alchemists.

143
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,980
We're the Elric brothers.

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,840
Not to brag or anything, but we're pretty
well known.

145
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,820
Elrics?

146
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,780
Not familiar.

147
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,740
We don't have any alchemists in these
parts.

148
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,720
I fix things for a living though.

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
Let me know if you need a job.

150

He doesn't need any work.

151
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,940
That's Edward Elric, the Fullmetal
Alchemist.

152
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,940
He's been a celebrity around D City.

153
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,400
They say he's a real child prodigy.

154
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:55,756
Heh.

155
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,200
Wow, a real-life famous person.

156
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,860
I see, you got the name Fullmetal because
you wear that armor.

157
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,780
Hey, would you come to my daughter's
birthday party?

158
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,300
Uh, I'm not the Fullmetal Alchemist.

159
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,460
He is.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,460
You mean that little shorty there?

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,440
Shorty‽

162
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Could a shorty do this?

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,100
What else you wanna call me, a half-bite
beach-proud midget?

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm still growing, you backwater desert
idiots!

165
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:21,080
I see there's plenty of excitement around
here today.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,260
Ah, Rose.

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,740
Don't mind me, I'd
hate to spoil all the fun.

168
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
That's okay.

169
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,020
My name's Alphonse Elric.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
Nice to meet you.

171
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:37,560
And I'm Edward, Al's older brother,
also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist.

172
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:38,562
Older brother?

173
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,284
But shouldn't it be the other way around?

174
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,015
ERR!

175
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Easy, Edward.

176
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,835
Hehehehe

177
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,840
Hey Rose, have you finished
your shopping for today's offering?

178
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Yeah.

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Well then, maybe you could take them to
Temple with you.

180
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,360
They say they're looking for something.

181
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,540
I bet Father Cornelo could help out.

182
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,840
You know, have them ask for God's grace.

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,020
Uh, that's okay.

184
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,928
We don't really... It's alright if
you don't have an offering today.

185
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,120
And besides, he has rooms for
travelers you could stay there tonight.

186
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,360
Thanks, but, uh...

187
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,880
As a matter of fact, we'd love to
take you up on that, wouldn't we, Al?

188
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
We would?

189
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,880
You mean you want to?

190
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,540
It sure is nice to see
a smile on Rose's face.

192
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah, she's beginning to
act like her old self again.

193
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Her heart must be healing at last.

194
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey Al, remember that woman at the shop?

195
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
She knew me.

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Have we met before?

197
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,580
No, I don't think so.

198
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
You shouldn't worry.

199
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Hm?

200
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm sure Cornelo will help you find what
you're looking for.

201
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,920
And besides, if you show him you're
faithful, I bet he could make you taller.

202
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,860
What's wrong with you people?

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,940
I'm not short!

204
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,260
You come from a desert
tribe of giants or something!

205
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,280
Edward, please!

206
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,400
You want some of this too?

207
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,560
Serve in true faith that all thy prayers
may be answered.

208
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,459
As a man opens blinds
to let the light flood in, so

209
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,720
open thy heart that the
sun god may shine on you.

210
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,500
Choice words is always your holiness.

211
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,940
Yes, Father.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,340
We'd be lost without you.

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Father Cornelo?

214
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Ah, Rose.

215
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Pardon me, Cray.

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
May I put some travelers
in the pilgrim's quarters?

217
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,140
You really delight in helping
others solve their troubles, don't you?

218
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,150
Well, that's what you teach us,
Father Cornelo.

219
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
So that's what I do.

220
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Or try to.

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,260
And God sees those good deeds
and writes them all down in stone.

222
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,780
But you must be patient, Rose.

223
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,820
We need a little more time
to grant the miracle you seek.

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes.

225
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,440
I spoke to Rose.

226
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
That grave belongs to her boyfriend.

227
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,800
He was all she had.

228
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,420
Her parents died when
she was a little girl.

229
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,580
She's convinced that Cornelo
can bring him back to life.

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,420
And he's leading her on and
letting her think he can do it.

231
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,040
Well, maybe he can.

232
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,520
What if Cornelo really is a holy man?

233
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Those scriptures.

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,640
Maybe there is something else out there.

235
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,560
Something we can't explain.

236
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,840
Don't count on it.

237
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
What do you think?

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
Well, it looks pretty obvious.

239
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,340
He's using alchemy.

240
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Yeah, but still.

241
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,220
Something's wrong.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,360
It's not equal... Hey, guys!

243
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,940
How are you liking your
first miracle gathering?

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
He's amazing, isn't he?

245
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,739
Well, he's an amazing
actor, I'll give him that.

246
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,180
But those aren't miracles.

247
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,939
He's swindling you.

248
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,500
Now, Ed, we don't know that.

249
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
We just know he's using alchemy and he's
ignoring the laws.

250
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,721
What laws?

251
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,120
This isn't witchcraft.
It's a science.

252
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,876
And you don't make things out of thin air.

253
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,620
In chemistry, a reaction has to be
balanced.

254
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
So does alchemy.

255
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,640
It's an equation, Rose.

256
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,760
Your output has to be of equal mass to the
materials you started with.

257
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,600
The base elements have to be similar,
too.

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,320
Like the radio I fixed.

259
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,920
I can make it bigger.

260
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
Or a tree or something.

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
It's our founding principle.

262
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,740
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

263
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,740
But that Holy
bastards totally disregarding the law.

264
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Because he's working miracles!

265
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,840
What do you say now, Ed?

266
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,140
I'll bet you can't do that with alchemy.

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,180
It's a true miracle.

268
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,080
It has to be.

269
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Edward Elric?

270
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes, Cray.

271
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,100
Word has it that he was certified as a state
alchemist when he was only 12 years old.

272
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,040
They call him the Fullmetal Alchemist.

273
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,600
You're sure it's him, Father?

274
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm afraid so.

275
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,560
The military they represent must have
witnessed our paradise and wished to intervene.

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
They are greedy, evil souls.

277
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,580
We must save my children from them.

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Understand?

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,260
I will carry out the will of God.

280
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,540
Your heavenly reward
will be great, my dear Cray.

281
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,100
The boy's presence troubles me.

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't like it.

283
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,560
Don't you worry.

284
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,060
Even if Cray should fail,
there is one other way.

285
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,510
So?

286
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,916
If you pray and polish
the altar enough times,

287
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,871
Someone who's dead
will be brought back to life?

288
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,970
Something like that.

289
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,490
Water, 35 liters.

290
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,170
Carbon, 20 kilograms.

291
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,930
Ammonia, 4 liters.

292
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,750
Lime, 1.5 kilograms.

293
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,790
Phosphorus, 800 grams.

294
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,010
Salt, 250 grams.

295
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,690
Saltpeter, 100 grams.

296
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,350
Sulfur, 80 grams.

297
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,710
Fluorine, 7.5.

298
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,810
Iron, 5.

299
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,310
Silicon, 3 grams.

300
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,909
And trace amounts of 15 other elements.

301
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,910
What's that?

302
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,090
It's all the ingredients of the
average adult human body,

303
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,570
down to the last specks of
protein in your eyelashes.

304
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,470
And even though science has given us the
entire physical breakdown, there's never

305
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:39,150
been a successful attempt
at bringing a human to life.

306
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,130
There's still something missing.

307
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,670
Something scientists haven't been
able to find in centuries of research.

308
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,007
So what makes you
think that hack-job priest

309
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:49,811
with his parlor tricks
is going to be able to?

310
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,362
And in case you're
wondering, all those

311
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,490
ingredients can be bought
on a child's allowance.

312
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,230
Humans can be built on the cheap,
if there's no magic to it.

313
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,890
Well, if there's no magic, then you bring
someone back to life!

314
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,370
Just a matter of time, Rose.

315
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,810
Science will find a way.

316
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,590
Science is the answer to everything.

317
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,090
If I were you, I'd drop the scriptures and
pick up an alchemy book.

318
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,690
We're the closest things to gods there
are.

319
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,390
You're not a god.

320
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,850
You're nothing close to it.

321
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,210
And neither is the sun.

322
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,130
It's just a mass of hydrogen.

323
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,190
Get close to it like Cornelo claims,
and all you'll do is burn up.

324
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,030
Great, Ed.

325
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,850
Push your total cynicism on someone else.

326
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,670
Don't worry, Elric.

327
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,130
Your brother will join you soon.

328
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,140
Cray what are you doing?

329
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
These two are enemies of God.

330
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,880
This is his will, Rose, not mine.

331
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,980
I don't think so, mister.

332
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,940
I got it!

333
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I got it!

334
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Strike!

335
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,560
He doesn't have a head!

336
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,900
Yeah, that's Al.

337
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
Please don't be scared, Rose.

338
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,000
This is how I am.

339
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,360
But you're not there.

340
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
It's true.

341
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,980
I don't have a body.

342
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
But I'm here.

343
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,920
This is my punishment for setting foot on
holy ground where mortals are forbidden.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,580
We made a mistake, Rose.

345
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,640
And we're paying for it.

346
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Rose, wait!

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Cray was right.

348
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
They are evil.

349
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
What have I done?

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,300
They made me doubt you, Cornelo.

351
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Forgive me.

352
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Please.

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,820
I can't see a church
social down here, can you?

354
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,320
There she is!

355
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,439
You've wrestled with the
darkness and prevailed Rose.

356
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,620
Thank you for bringing them here.

357
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,199
State alchemists, brutal enforcers.

358
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,640
I had a feeling one of you
would show up someday.

359
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Well, let's not chalk that up
to pious premonitions, okay?

360
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,840
You knew we'd come for the stone.

361
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,975
Errr.

362
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,620
Do you mean this, young man?

363
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,380
I knew it.

364
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Alchemy without a transmutation circle.

365
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,400
Completely ignoring the
principle of equivalent exchange.

366
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,600
It could only mean one thing.

367
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,580
Yes, the mythical gem.

368
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
The legendary amplifier.

369
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,920
The philosopher's stone.

370
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
That's it, Al.

371
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
It's ours.

372
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,980
Cough it up, Cornelo.

373
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,100
That stone belongs to me now.

374
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,920
And if you hand it
over peacefully, I won't

375
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,740
tell the people here
what you've been doing.

376
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
What's that?

377
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,260
Restoring their town to peace and
prosperity?

378
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,400
Do you know what would happen if my
miraculous wonders suddenly stopped?

379
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,760
Nobody wants that.

380
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
Do they, Rose?

381
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,739
Don't listen to him, Rose!

382
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,040
He's just a conman!

383
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,340
Nonsense.

384
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,860
Would a conman restored
life to a dying town?

385
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,480
When I arrived, this town was
full of strife and I brought peace.

386
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,620
They came to me with parched
throats and I created water.

387
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,500
I built buildings for them
and even gave them money.

388
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,298
They believed that
heaven had forsaken them,

389
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,941
but I gave them hope
and became their prophet.

390
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Why does the military
want to destroy all this?

391
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,760
I don't care what the military wants.

392
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm here for me.

393
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,460
What?

394
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,640
I need that stone.

395
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,100
We need it to make something right again.

396
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,120
So that's it?

397
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,659
This is all about you and what you want.

398
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,640
What about us?
You don't care.

399
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,181
Rose, we're only
trying to... It's no use.

400
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,480
Enough.

401
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,180
There is no point in arguing.

402
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,000
If you want the Philosopher's
Stone, you'll have to take it from me!

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
AHHH!

404
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,924
Al!

405
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,236
Ed!

406
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Hold on!

407
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,620
Armor is a disadvantage in soft sand.

408
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,560
You can't draw transmutation
circles in it either.

409
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,180
Let me introduce you
to one of my creations.

410
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,520
You of all people will
be able to appreciate this.

411
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,600
A Chimera.

412
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,180
You combined animals.

413
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
The most depraved kind of alchemy there
is.

414
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,240
Maybe so, but most effective!

415
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,641
ROAR!!!

416
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,640
All right, big fella.

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
You want to play?

418
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,360
Let's go for it!

419
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,622
H-H-How'd-did you do that
without a transmutation circle?

420
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,120
Bring me his head, my pet!

421
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,980
NHAHAHA Now snap it!

422
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,100
Err
Wrong leg, pal!

423
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,600
And here's the right arm!

424
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,755
AHH!

425
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,779
Errrrr.....
Huh?

426
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,803
[SQUELCHING NOISES]

427
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,980
What's the matter, you poor bastard?

428
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
Can't get a good taste?

429
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,960
Mouth-watering... Ayy Glulitany...

430
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,260
That's impossible!

431
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,400
Those claws on your leg!

432
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,720
The teeth on your arm!

433
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,820
No one could survive that!

434
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Unless...

435
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:06,398
Ah.

436
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:07,500
Your limbs!

437
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
They're fake!

438
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Brilliant deduction!

439
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Oh, God!

440
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,180
Don't look away, Rose!

441
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,020
You need to see what happens
when you try to bring a human to life!

442
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,120
When you cross into God's
territory or whatever the hell it is!

443
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
Is this what you want‽

444
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Look!

445
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,920
His arm!

446
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
His leg!

447
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
They're machines!

448
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I see.

449
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Now I understand you, Elric.

450
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,780
You crossed the line.

451
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,187
You did what is strictly forbidden.

452
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,360
You tried to create human life and
your bodies were taken to the other side.

453
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,060
Told you, Rose.

454
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,920
Get too close to the sun and you burn.

455
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Apparently so.

456
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,680
But you were crazy enough
to find out for yourself!

457
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,440
You are the Fullmetal!

458
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,680
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

459
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,840
Fullmetal Alchemist.

460
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,329
Episode Two, Body
of the Sanctioned.

461
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,310
A counterfeit Philosopher's Stone,
brings false promises, and false relief.

462
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,720
But the tears it brings, are real.
