1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,560
That ought to do it.

00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:16,860
You ready?

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,140
Don't be scared, Al.

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,060
Everything's perfect.

5
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:29,940
Let's go for it.

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:51,850
Alchemy the science of
understanding the structure of matter.

7
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,370
Breaking it down, then reconstructing it
as something else.

8
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,590
It can even make gold from lead.

9
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,850
But alchemy is a science.

10
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,730
So it must follow the natural laws.

11
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:07,190
To create, something of equal value must
be lost.

12
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,230
This is the principle of equivalent
exchange.

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,263
But on that night, I
learned the value of some

14
00:01:19,264 --> 00:01:23,091
things can't be measured
on a simple scale.

15

Wait Winry, look!

18
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,910
My brother and I knew the laws of science.

19
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,230
Of equivalent exchange.

20
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,530
That gain required sacrifice.

21
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,090
That something had to be taken from us.

22
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,230
But we thought there was
nothing more we could lose.

23
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:45,550
We were wrong.

24
00:01:49,905 --> 00:01:50,905
No.

Al, no!

Please God.

It's nothing but sand!

If I had some grass, I could turn it into
bread.

00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,569
Get back here!

52

Nothing!

Are you ok brother?

It's your fault for not stopping when I
said.

00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:11,590
You wouldn't stop either if someone were
chasing you.

62

Shut up.

Wait a second.

the air.

Hm?

00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,590
Is it blood?

00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:46,870
Nope.
More like blood red wine.

You'll have to forgive me.

Children of God who live upon this land,
pray in faith that ye may be saved.

00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,338
As sun lights the day,
so does the sun god Leto

illuminate thy path, and
draw near to the sun.

Well, that's freakish.

95
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,610
Some kind of religious broadcast.

96

Your buddy's in a suit of
armor, and you're wearing

gloves in the desert,
and you call us freaks?

May this town be blessed, and may we
continue to experience growth and prosperity.

100
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,370
You street performers?

I don't think so, Pops.

102

Do I look like a clown to you?

103
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:06,330
Well, you must have some
reason to journey out this far.

104
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:09,190
We're just trying to track something down,
that's all.

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,550
Now, who is this guy on your airwaves?

106
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,930
Why, that's Sir Cornello.

107
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,671
Ah.
Doesn't ring a bell.

108
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,750
You're kidding me!

109
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:17,637
You've never heard of the great prophet
Cornello?

110
00:06:18,350 --> 00:06:19,630
What's great about him?

111
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,550
He can perform miracles, for one thing.

112
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,030
I've never seen anything like it.

113
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:25,768
This town was a godforsaken
dust bowl before Cornello

114
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:28,930
got here and transformed
it into a desert paradise.

115
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,810
Cornello can even forgive sins.

116
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,430
Yeah, we're on the sun god's
good side because of him.

117
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,550
He gives us blessings.

118
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:35,791
Ah.
I just remembered.

119
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:37,010
We have to be somewhere.

120
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:39,930
You ready to split?

121
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:40,930
Yeah.

122
00:06:40,931 --> 00:06:41,930
Okay.

123
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,850
Oops.

124
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:49,270
Now you've done it, buddy.

suit?

Don't bust a lung, Grandpa.

127
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,388
We can fix it.

128
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:55,730
It's in a thousand pieces!

129
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,130
I'm sorry.

130
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,890
Let me try.

131
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Sure.

132
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:03,910
That drawing.

133
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,010
What's it for?

134
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,389
You'll see in just a second.

135
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,790
It's called the transmutation circle.

136
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,490
Okay.
Here goes.

137
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:21,600
If you are lost, follow
me and you will be found.

138
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,960
It's really a land of prophets.

139
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:27,560
Your buddy can work miracles like
Cornello.

140
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,800
It's nothing like that.

141
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,280
It's science.

142
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,380
We're Alchemists.

143
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,980
We're the Elric brothers.

144
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,840
Not to brag or anything, but we're pretty
well known.

145
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,820
Elrics?

146
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,780
Not familiar.

147
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,740
We don't have any alchemists in these
parts.

148
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,720
I fix things for a living though.

149
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
Let me know if you need a job.

He doesn't need any work.

151
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,940
That's Edward Elric, the Fullmetal
Alchemist.

152
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,940
He's been a celebrity around D City.

153
00:07:51,101 --> 00:07:54,400
They say he's a real child prodigy.

154
00:07:54,424 --> 00:07:55,756
Heh.

155
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,200
Wow, a real-life famous person.

156
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:01,860
I see, you got the name Fullmetal because
you wear that armor.

157
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,780
Hey, would you come to my daughter's
birthday party?

158
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,300
Uh, I'm not the Fullmetal Alchemist.

159
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,460
He is.

160
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,460
You mean that little shorty there?

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,440
Shorty‽

162
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:13,460
Could a shorty do this?

163
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,100
What else you wanna call me, a half-bite
beach-proud midget?

164
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,440
I'm still growing, you backwater desert
idiots!

165
00:08:18,441 --> 00:08:21,080
I see there's plenty of excitement around
here today.

166
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,260
Ah, Rose.

167
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,740
Don't mind me, I'd
hate to spoil all the fun.

168
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,180
That's okay.

169
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,020
My name's Alphonse Elric.

170
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
Nice to meet you.

171
00:08:33,121 --> 00:08:37,560
And I'm Edward, Al's older brother,
also known as the Fullmetal Alchemist.

172
00:08:37,562 --> 00:08:38,562
Older brother?

173
00:08:38,564 --> 00:08:40,284
But shouldn't it be the other way around?

174
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:41,015
ERR!

175
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Easy, Edward.

176
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,835
Hehehehe

177
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,840
Hey Rose, have you finished
your shopping for today's offering?

178
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,180
Yeah.

179
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,720
Well then, maybe you could take them to
Temple with you.

180
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,360
They say they're looking for something.

181
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,540
I bet Father Cornelo could help out.

182
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,840
You know, have them ask for God's grace.

183
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,020
Uh, that's okay.

184
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,928
We don't really... It's alright if
you don't have an offering today.

185
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,120
And besides, he has rooms for
travelers you could stay there tonight.

186
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:05,360
Thanks, but, uh...

187
00:09:05,361 --> 00:09:08,880
As a matter of fact, we'd love to
take you up on that, wouldn't we, Al?

188
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,300
We would?

189
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,880
You mean you want to?

190
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Mm-hmm.

191
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:19,540
It sure is nice to see
a smile on Rose's face.

192
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:22,900
Yeah, she's beginning to
act like her old self again.

193
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,760
Her heart must be healing at last.

194
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,200
Hey Al, remember that woman at the shop?

195
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,620
She knew me.

196
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
Have we met before?

197
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,580
No, I don't think so.

198
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
You shouldn't worry.

199
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,860
Hm?

200
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,600
I'm sure Cornelo will help you find what
you're looking for.

201
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,920
And besides, if you show him you're
faithful, I bet he could make you taller.

202
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,860
What's wrong with you people?

203
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,940
I'm not short!

204
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,260
You come from a desert
tribe of giants or something!

205
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:57,280
Edward, please!

206
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,400
You want some of this too?

207
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:04,560
Serve in true faith that all thy prayers
may be answered.

208
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,459
As a man opens blinds
to let the light flood in, so

209
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,720
open thy heart that the
sun god may shine on you.

210
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,500
Choice words is always your holiness.

211
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:16,940
Yes, Father.

212
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,340
We'd be lost without you.

213
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Father Cornelo?

214
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
Ah, Rose.

215
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,520
Pardon me, Cray.

216
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,080
May I put some travelers
in the pilgrim's quarters?

217
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,140
You really delight in helping
others solve their troubles, don't you?

218
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:35,150
Well, that's what you teach us,
Father Cornelo.

219
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,180
So that's what I do.

220
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:37,700
Or try to.

221
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,260
And God sees those good deeds
and writes them all down in stone.

222
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,780
But you must be patient, Rose.

223
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,820
We need a little more time
to grant the miracle you seek.

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Yes.

225
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,440
I spoke to Rose.

226
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,820
That grave belongs to her boyfriend.

227
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,800
He was all she had.

228
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,420
Her parents died when
she was a little girl.

229
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,580
She's convinced that Cornelo
can bring him back to life.

230
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,420
And he's leading her on and
letting her think he can do it.

231
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,040
Well, maybe he can.

232
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,520
What if Cornelo really is a holy man?

233
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,440
Those scriptures.

234
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,640
Maybe there is something else out there.

235
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,560
Something we can't explain.

236
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,840
Don't count on it.

237
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
What do you think?

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
Well, it looks pretty obvious.

239
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,340
He's using alchemy.

240
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,020
Yeah, but still.

241
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,220
Something's wrong.

242
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,360
It's not equal... Hey, guys!

243
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,940
How are you liking your
first miracle gathering?

244
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
He's amazing, isn't he?

245
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,739
Well, he's an amazing
actor, I'll give him that.

246
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,180
But those aren't miracles.

247
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,939
He's swindling you.

248
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,500
Now, Ed, we don't know that.

249
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,720
We just know he's using alchemy and he's
ignoring the laws.

250
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:08,721
What laws?

251
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,120
This isn't witchcraft.
It's a science.

252
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,876
And you don't make things out of thin air.

253
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,620
In chemistry, a reaction has to be
balanced.

254
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,820
So does alchemy.

255
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,640
It's an equation, Rose.

256
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:24,760
Your output has to be of equal mass to the
materials you started with.

257
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,600
The base elements have to be similar,
too.

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,320
Like the radio I fixed.

259
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,920
I can make it bigger.

260
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,440
Or a tree or something.

261
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,000
It's our founding principle.

262
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,740
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

263
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,740
But that Holy
bastards totally disregarding the law.

264
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,280
Because he's working miracles!

265
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,840
What do you say now, Ed?

266
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:55,140
I'll bet you can't do that with alchemy.

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,180
It's a true miracle.

268
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,080
It has to be.

269
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Edward Elric?

270
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,920
Yes, Cray.

271
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:08,100
Word has it that he was certified as a state
alchemist when he was only 12 years old.

272
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,040
They call him the Fullmetal Alchemist.

273
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,600
You're sure it's him, Father?

274
00:13:12,601 --> 00:13:13,960
I'm afraid so.

275
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:19,560
The military they represent must have
witnessed our paradise and wished to intervene.

276
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
They are greedy, evil souls.

277
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,580
We must save my children from them.

278
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,120
Understand?

279
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,260
I will carry out the will of God.

280
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,540
Your heavenly reward
will be great, my dear Cray.

281
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,100
The boy's presence troubles me.

282
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,520
I don't like it.

283
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,560
Don't you worry.

284
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,060
Even if Cray should fail,
there is one other way.

285
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,510
So?

286
00:13:50,511 --> 00:13:52,916
If you pray and polish
the altar enough times,

287
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,871
Someone who's dead
will be brought back to life?

288
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,970
Something like that.

289
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,490
Water, 35 liters.

290
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,170
Carbon, 20 kilograms.

291
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:08,930
Ammonia, 4 liters.

292
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,750
Lime, 1.5 kilograms.

293
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,790
Phosphorus, 800 grams.

294
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,010
Salt, 250 grams.

295
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,690
Saltpeter, 100 grams.

296
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,350
Sulfur, 80 grams.

297
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,710
Fluorine, 7.5.

298
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:20,810
Iron, 5.

299
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,310
Silicon, 3 grams.

300
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,909
And trace amounts of 15 other elements.

301
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:25,910
What's that?

302
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:29,090
It's all the ingredients of the
average adult human body,

303
00:14:29,091 --> 00:14:31,570
down to the last specks of
protein in your eyelashes.

304
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,470
And even though science has given us the
entire physical breakdown, there's never

305
00:14:36,471 --> 00:14:39,150
been a successful attempt
at bringing a human to life.

306
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:41,130
There's still something missing.

307
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,670
Something scientists haven't been
able to find in centuries of research.

308
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,007
So what makes you
think that hack-job priest

309
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:49,811
with his parlor tricks
is going to be able to?

310
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,362
And in case you're
wondering, all those

311
00:14:52,363 --> 00:14:54,490
ingredients can be bought
on a child's allowance.

312
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:58,230
Humans can be built on the cheap,
if there's no magic to it.

313
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,890
Well, if there's no magic, then you bring
someone back to life!

314
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,370
Just a matter of time, Rose.

315
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,810
Science will find a way.

316
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,590
Science is the answer to everything.

317
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:11,090
If I were you, I'd drop the scriptures and
pick up an alchemy book.

318
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,690
We're the closest things to gods there
are.

319
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,390
You're not a god.

320
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:16,850
You're nothing close to it.

321
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:18,210
And neither is the sun.

322
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,130
It's just a mass of hydrogen.

323
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:25,190
Get close to it like Cornelo claims,
and all you'll do is burn up.

324
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:29,030
Great, Ed.

325
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:31,850
Push your total cynicism on someone else.

326
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,670
Don't worry, Elric.

327
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:37,130
Your brother will join you soon.

328
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:46,140
Cray what are you doing?

329
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,400
These two are enemies of God.

330
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,880
This is his will, Rose, not mine.

331
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,980
I don't think so, mister.

332
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:58,940
I got it!

333
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I got it!

334
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Strike!

335
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,560
He doesn't have a head!

336
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,900
Yeah, that's Al.

337
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,460
Please don't be scared, Rose.

338
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,000
This is how I am.

339
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,360
But you're not there.

340
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,480
It's true.

341
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,980
I don't have a body.

342
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,220
But I'm here.

343
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:21,920
This is my punishment for setting foot on
holy ground where mortals are forbidden.

344
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,580
We made a mistake, Rose.

345
00:16:23,581 --> 00:16:25,640
And we're paying for it.

346
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
Rose, wait!

347
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
Cray was right.

348
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,280
They are evil.

349
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:34,420
What have I done?

350
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,300
They made me doubt you, Cornelo.

351
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Forgive me.

352
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,020
Please.

353
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:43,820
I can't see a church
social down here, can you?

354
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,320
There she is!

355
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,439
You've wrestled with the
darkness and prevailed Rose.

356
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,620
Thank you for bringing them here.

357
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,199
State alchemists, brutal enforcers.

358
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,640
I had a feeling one of you
would show up someday.

359
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Well, let's not chalk that up
to pious premonitions, okay?

360
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,840
You knew we'd come for the stone.

361
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,975
Errr.

362
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,620
Do you mean this, young man?

363
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:15,380
I knew it.

364
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,480
Alchemy without a transmutation circle.

365
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,400
Completely ignoring the
principle of equivalent exchange.

366
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,600
It could only mean one thing.

367
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:24,580
Yes, the mythical gem.

368
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,000
The legendary amplifier.

369
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,920
The philosopher's stone.

370
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
That's it, Al.

371
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:31,700
It's ours.

372
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,980
Cough it up, Cornelo.

373
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:36,100
That stone belongs to me now.

374
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,920
And if you hand it
over peacefully, I won't

375
00:17:37,921 --> 00:17:39,740
tell the people here
what you've been doing.

376
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,840
What's that?

377
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,260
Restoring their town to peace and
prosperity?

378
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,400
Do you know what would happen if my
miraculous wonders suddenly stopped?

379
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,760
Nobody wants that.

380
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,960
Do they, Rose?

381
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,739
Don't listen to him, Rose!

382
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,040
He's just a conman!

383
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,340
Nonsense.

384
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,860
Would a conman restored
life to a dying town?

385
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,480
When I arrived, this town was
full of strife and I brought peace.

386
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,620
They came to me with parched
throats and I created water.

387
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,500
I built buildings for them
and even gave them money.

388
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,298
They believed that
heaven had forsaken them,

389
00:18:10,299 --> 00:18:12,941
but I gave them hope
and became their prophet.

390
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,020
Why does the military
want to destroy all this?

391
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,760
I don't care what the military wants.

392
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,020
I'm here for me.

393
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,460
What?

394
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,640
I need that stone.

395
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,100
We need it to make something right again.

396
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,120
So that's it?

397
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,659
This is all about you and what you want.

398
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,640
What about us?
You don't care.

399
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,181
Rose, we're only
trying to... It's no use.

400
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,480
Enough.

401
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,180
There is no point in arguing.

402
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:41,000
If you want the Philosopher's
Stone, you'll have to take it from me!

403
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,400
AHHH!

404
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:45,924
Al!

405
00:18:46,148 --> 00:18:47,236
Ed!

406
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,360
Hold on!

407
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,620
Armor is a disadvantage in soft sand.

408
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,560
You can't draw transmutation
circles in it either.

409
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,180
Let me introduce you
to one of my creations.

410
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,520
You of all people will
be able to appreciate this.

411
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:03,600
A Chimera.

412
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,180
You combined animals.

413
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
The most depraved kind of alchemy there
is.

414
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,240
Maybe so, but most effective!

415
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,641
ROAR!!!

416
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,640
All right, big fella.

417
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
You want to play?

418
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,360
Let's go for it!

419
00:19:35,562 --> 00:19:38,622
H-H-How'd-did you do that
without a transmutation circle?

420
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,120
Bring me his head, my pet!

421
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,980
NHAHAHA Now snap it!

422
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,100
Err
Wrong leg, pal!

423
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,600
And here's the right arm!

424
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,755
AHH!

425
00:20:32,979 --> 00:20:35,779
Errrrr.....
Huh?

426
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,803
[SQUELCHING NOISES]

427
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,980
What's the matter, you poor bastard?

428
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,820
Can't get a good taste?

429
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,960
Mouth-watering... Ayy Glulitany...

430
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,260
That's impossible!

431
00:20:58,361 --> 00:21:00,400
Those claws on your leg!

432
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,720
The teeth on your arm!

433
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,820
No one could survive that!

434
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Unless...

435
00:21:05,622 --> 00:21:06,398
Ah.

436
00:21:06,422 --> 00:21:07,500
Your limbs!

437
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
They're fake!

438
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:09,940
Brilliant deduction!

439
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,300
Oh, God!

440
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,180
Don't look away, Rose!

441
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:18,020
You need to see what happens
when you try to bring a human to life!

442
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,120
When you cross into God's
territory or whatever the hell it is!

443
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,340
Is this what you want‽

444
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,660
Look!

445
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,920
His arm!

446
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,240
His leg!

447
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
They're machines!

448
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,400
I see.

449
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Now I understand you, Elric.

450
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,780
You crossed the line.

451
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,187
You did what is strictly forbidden.

452
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:39,360
You tried to create human life and
your bodies were taken to the other side.

453
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,060
Told you, Rose.

454
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,920
Get too close to the sun and you burn.

455
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,140
Apparently so.

456
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,680
But you were crazy enough
to find out for yourself!

457
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,440
You are the Fullmetal!

458
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,680
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

459
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,840
Fullmetal Alchemist.

460
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:43,329
Episode Two, Body
of the Sanctioned.

461
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,310
A counterfeit Philosopher's Stone,
brings false promises, and false relief.

462
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,720
But the tears it brings, are real.
