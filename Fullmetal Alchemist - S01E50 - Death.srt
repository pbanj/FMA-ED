1
00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:16,323
Where am I, what city is this?

2
00:00:18,203 --> 00:00:19,083
Hello?

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,770
Who are you?

4
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:34,211
Oh hell, I think I'm in someone else's
body.

5
00:00:59,045 --> 00:01:00,158
This is incredible.

6
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:02,680
Why have I never heard of these flying
machines?

7
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:07,698
It seems in this world scientific
discovery developed along a different track.

8
00:01:08,358 --> 00:01:11,116
Physics and advanced machinery instead of
alchemy.

9
00:01:11,611 --> 00:01:14,258
Came as quite a shock to me too when I
arrived.

10
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,312
In this world?

11
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:17,759
I thought you realized.

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,480
You see...

13
00:01:20,932 --> 00:01:23,632
This is the other side of the gate.

14
00:01:44,243 --> 00:01:45,786
The Philosopher's Stone.

15
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:50,990
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange and

16
00:01:50,991 --> 00:01:56,804
alchemy, may gain without sacrifice,
create without equal exchange.

17
00:01:57,977 --> 00:01:59,111
We searched for it.

18
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:00,964
And we found it.

19
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,159
It sounds like there's some kind of ruckus
going on at Central.

20
00:03:54,566 --> 00:03:56,346
It's too chaotic to know what though.

21
00:03:57,031 --> 00:04:00,436
You might say that the one advantage to
being completely surrounded with little

22
00:04:00,461 --> 00:04:03,797
hope for escape is that we don't have to
deal with the goings on at Central.

23
00:04:04,755 --> 00:04:08,795
I guess it doesn't really matter what's happening
as long as Colonel Mustang is able to succeed.

24
00:04:09,043 --> 00:04:12,669
Yeah, but I think the important question
is... What exactly is he succeeding at?

25
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,026
Because we sure as hell haven't been told.

26
00:04:15,466 --> 00:04:17,486
For all we know, it's a revolution.

27
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,689
Lieutenant Colonel!

28
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,880
They've sent in the tanks!

29
00:04:25,996 --> 00:04:27,575
Why don't you let me handle this?

30
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:30,306
I haven't perfected my Colonel Mustang
impersonation.

31
00:04:50,887 --> 00:04:51,367
Hmm?

32
00:04:52,735 --> 00:04:53,895
Is something wrong?

33
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:54,906
Not really.

34
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:01,086
No matter what it is, you know you can
talk to me, Selim.

35
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:04,599
I'm actually quite good at keeping
secrets.

36
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:08,457
So, if you have something to say,
I won't tell, not even to Mom.

37
00:05:12,124 --> 00:05:12,980
I'm sorry, Father.

38
00:05:13,427 --> 00:05:14,006
Hm?

39
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:16,907
Well, I... I saw your secret treasure.

40
00:05:30,896 --> 00:05:32,126
I didn't mean to.

41
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,720
Honest.

42
00:05:32,993 --> 00:05:34,173
I'm sure you didn't.

43
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,000
It's just I hadn't planned on showing you
until you were older.

44
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:38,987
So you aren't angry?

45
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,273
I could never be angry with my dear Selim.

46
00:05:46,214 --> 00:05:49,296
You do understand that by giving you this
key, I'm trusting you with my life,

47
00:05:49,321 --> 00:05:51,300
so I expect you to protect it at all
costs.

48
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,500
Yes, Your Excellency the Führer.

49
00:05:58,166 --> 00:05:58,946
What's wrong.

50
00:05:59,201 --> 00:06:00,521
There's a strange woman here.

51
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:02,295
She demands to see you immediately.

52
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,120
First Lieutenant Hawkeye.

53
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,260
What a surprise.

54
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,880
Forgive my intrusion, Your Excellency,
but I must speak with you.

55
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,140
Hurry up!

56
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,500
She's headed towards the front!

57
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,380
Stop her!

58
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:45,945
Okay, let's move.

59
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:47,433
Where are we supposed to go?

60
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:50,717
We've set up a rally point for all the
dissenting soldiers to regroup.

61
00:06:51,342 --> 00:06:53,682
If we go down, we'll do it together.

62
00:07:03,462 --> 00:07:04,690
What news?

63
00:07:05,896 --> 00:07:06,976
We're in trouble!

64
00:07:07,996 --> 00:07:11,523
There's been a breach of security at the
Führer's mansion!

65
00:07:14,523 --> 00:07:16,983
Put your mind at rest, Führer King.

66
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:19,823
I'm on my way.

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,447
This world is tragically violent.

68
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,592
Throughout the course of this war, millions of people
have been killed with the use of highly toxic gases.

69
00:07:32,086 --> 00:07:35,215
But the single most terrifying instrument
of death is yet to come.

70
00:07:35,553 --> 00:07:37,773
You saw it in the gate, didn't you?

71
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:43,980
The lives of those that have died and will
die in this world become the energy for.

72
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:45,567
the alchemy used in ours.

73
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:46,513
The energy?

74
00:07:47,393 --> 00:07:48,635
That doesn't make any sense.

75
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,500
What about the la..

76
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:50,792
Law of equivalent exchange.

77
00:07:51,466 --> 00:07:53,106
There's something you don't understand.

78
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:56,643
It takes more than equal mass to restore a
broken radio.

79
00:07:57,166 --> 00:08:00,386
The energy used to put it back together
must come from somewhere, too.

80
00:08:00,993 --> 00:08:04,353
And energy cannot be created or destroyed,
only redirected.

81
00:08:04,923 --> 00:08:06,035
So that's the secret?

82
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,200
The lives of the people who die here, cross the
gate and become energy we need for transmutations?

83
00:08:10,815 --> 00:08:12,255
Is that what you're telling me?

84
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:16,100
Inside all of us, there lies a smaller
version of the gate you pass through.

85
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,240
Alchemists have the ability to open their gates,
crossing worlds and feeding off the tragedies of this one.

86
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,860
It happens every time you draw

87
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,285
a circle or clap hands.

88
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:26,733
You sound just like that head case Dante!

89
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,920
All the same crap about there being no
equivalent exchange.

90
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:32,355
I wasn't aware that you knew about her.

91
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,806
I know everything.

92
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:36,700
I know the two of you were lovers because
I read the letter.

93
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:40,860
I know you've been keeping yourselves
alive, jumping from one body to another.

94
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:44,685
But what I don't understand is if you and
that evil bitch were so perfect together,

95
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,331
why did you feel the need to marry my
mother?

96
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:51,678
Did you get some sick satisfaction out of
pretending to be a normal human?

97
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,611
I loved your mother.

98
00:08:56,445 --> 00:08:59,545
With all of my being, I had never loved
until her.

99
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:02,165
You have to believe that.

100
00:09:02,904 --> 00:09:03,744
Then why?

101
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:05,263
Why did you leave us?

102
00:09:10,492 --> 00:09:12,592
I just couldn't let you see me like this.

103
00:09:12,996 --> 00:09:15,596
The thought of it was too much for me to
bear.

104
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,620
Come on, gluttony.

105
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:27,890
You're just one meal away from creating a
perfect stone.

106
00:09:31,853 --> 00:09:33,753
So, stuff your face, big guy.

107
00:09:34,033 --> 00:09:34,513
Lust!

108
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,660
Where did my lust go?

109
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:38,127
Where?

110
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:40,868
Look, half-wit!

111
00:09:40,893 --> 00:09:42,113
We're all waiting on you!

112
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,555
Now listen to me!

113
00:09:43,893 --> 00:09:47,373
If you don't get your fat ass over there right
now, I'll force him down your throat myself!

114
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:51,486
We've come too far for you to screw it up
now!

115
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,819
But where is she?

116
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:57,591
Where is she?

117
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,735
Where's Lust?

118
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,740
You poor thing.

119
00:10:01,126 --> 00:10:03,166
It seems there's no other way.

120
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:16,351
Gluttony?

121
00:10:17,177 --> 00:10:18,185
Keep your distance.

122
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:21,836
The only thing left inside of him now is
his urge to feed.

123
00:10:22,116 --> 00:10:26,796
Without his mind, there will be no more
human attachments to distract him.

124
00:10:27,396 --> 00:10:29,371
Now, he is pure.

125
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:34,630
I knew Dante couldn't create the stone,
at least not without my help.

126
00:10:35,164 --> 00:10:38,363
I thought if I just stayed in hiding,
she'd finally fade away.

127
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,206
But I had to do something once she'd set
her eyes on you.

128
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:44,797
So in return, she sent you beyond the
gate?

129
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:46,139
Not beyond the gate.

130
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,250
Just inside it.

131
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:52,704
And she separated my mind, body, and soul while I
was inside, leaving me to wander in that limbo forever.

132
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,398
But despite her efforts, I put myself back
together and wound up here.

133
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,275
Is that what happened to me?

134
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:00,525
Not quite.

135
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:04,243
The success of alchemy seems to be the
diverging point for these worlds.

136
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:08,305
We share the same history before that,
and much is still the same.

137
00:11:08,724 --> 00:11:12,225
As you see, there's a boy here that's
physically identical to you.

138
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,730
There's probably a boy like Al as well.

139
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:15,584
That makes sense.

140
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,930
But that doesn't explain how I got this
body.

141
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:22,540
It's highly probable that your true body
is still somewhere inside the gate.

142
00:11:22,565 --> 00:11:27,948
But your mind and soul have crossed over into this world,
and they were attracted like magnets to this Edward's body.

143
00:11:33,778 --> 00:11:36,621
Lieutenant Colonel Churchill needs to see
you immediately.

144
00:11:40,806 --> 00:11:41,586
Hey, wait!

145
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:43,866
Wait!

146
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:47,477
You must open the gate that's inside you.

147
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,860
Only then can you find your way back to
your true home, Edward.

148
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,860
But aren't you coming too?

149
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,692
I'm afraid that's not possible.

150
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:58,873
Since my body has already crossed the
gate, I'm completely a part of this world now.

151
00:11:59,492 --> 00:12:01,776
And because alchemy seems to be impossible
here, I'm stranded.

152
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,000
But luckily, it isn't too late for you.

153
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,066
There must be something we can do.

154
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:13,235
I know it's hard for you to understand,
but I believe it's best I'm staying here.

155
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,212
That way, I can live the remainder of my
life in the body your mother loved.

156
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:22,106
You should know I was relieved to find out
the law of equivalence wasn't true.

157
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:27,384
That people mustn't always be required to pay a
price in order to gain something of value in return.

158
00:12:27,558 --> 00:12:33,182
Because even if I lived for a thousand lifetimes, I
could never do enough to deserve the gift of my children.

159
00:12:33,433 --> 00:12:34,602
You and Al.

160
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,619
I can't agree with you.

161
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,170
I know if I try my hardest, I'll be
rewarded.

162
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,755
And I believe that applies to all of us.

163
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:51,535
It doesn't matter who you are.

164
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:53,875
If you work hard, it pays off.

165
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:56,272
I know equivalent exchange is true.

166
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,420
But this world...

167
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,650
If it's childish to believe in this,
so be it.

168
00:13:00,117 --> 00:13:04,676
I'd rather be considered a child than
follow a doctrine of cynicism and chaos.

169
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,180
Apathy.

170
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,239
I thought I didn't care, Dad.

171
00:13:07,356 --> 00:13:09,495
That I didn't need to believe in things.

172
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,799
But I was wrong.

173
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:17,607
It looks like a zeppelin's been hit.

174
00:13:58,299 --> 00:14:00,468
What about the location of Colonel Mustang?

175
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:03,789
As far as we know, he's been heading up a
campaign in the war against the North.

176
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,120
That's been a subterfuge.

177
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:08,244
He's been here the entire time,
plotting a way to take you down.

178
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,680
It's probably a rat.

179
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,400
There's no reason to be alarmed.

180
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,580
I'll have a look just to be safe.

181
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:19,895
You two stay here with my family.

182
00:14:20,283 --> 00:14:22,876
But, sir... In the unlikely event
that something should happen,

183
00:14:22,877 --> 00:14:25,789
I want you to take them to
Central Headquarters immediately.

184
00:14:56,156 --> 00:14:58,626
Why am I not surprised you decided to face
me alone?

185
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,767
Your behavior leads me to assume this
isn't the first time you've betrayed my trust.

186
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:06,366
You've got a hell of a lot of nerve
lecturing me about betrayal.

187
00:15:06,938 --> 00:15:09,125
Are you referring to the fact that I am...

188
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:10,753
...a Homunculus?

189
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,372
Whether or not you can call yourself a human
being is a non-issue as far as I'm concerned, Bradley.

190
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,881
Then what's the problem?

191
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:23,800
Ever since I've become Führer,
I've done nothing but improve this country

192
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:28,661
by winning wars, purifying our population,
and exponentially expanding our territory.

193
00:15:29,186 --> 00:15:30,906
You couldn't care less for this state.

194
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,114
All you wanted was the Philosopher's
Stone.

195
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:40,240
You started those conflicts because you knew people
pushed to despair by war tend to seek refuge in the Stone.

196
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,119
People are foolish.

197
00:15:42,493 --> 00:15:45,253
Foolish enough to let you profit off their
pain and suffering!

198
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,313
You've got me all wrong.

199
00:15:47,668 --> 00:15:51,965
To stop the human race from leading itself
to ruin, I intervene and take the Stone,

200
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,568
thereby preventing its use.

201
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,800
I think of myself as one of God's guardian
angels.

202
00:15:57,055 --> 00:15:58,515
There's no such thing as God.

203
00:15:58,903 --> 00:16:00,311
We can't know that for sure.

204
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:02,735
However, devils do exist.

205
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:05,120
They're the Alchemists who dare to get in
my way.

206
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,540
How unfortunate.

207
00:16:12,927 --> 00:16:17,667
A quick slash of my sword changes the air
currents, disrupting your precious alchemic reactions.

208
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,680
How can you expect to manipulate the air's
composition if it's constantly in flux?

209
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:27,486
My ultimate eye sees your alchemy at work.

210
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,037
Even if you did pull off a flame,
it wouldn't have any accuracy.

211
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,040
Soon, Rose, you will surrender yourself to
me.

212
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,233
Huh, Envy!

213
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,720
Do not allow him to use his alchemy!

214
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,046
Stop squirming!

215
00:17:09,373 --> 00:17:10,253
Bring her back!

216
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,192
Bring my mommy back to life!

217
00:17:12,446 --> 00:17:13,209
Please!

218
00:17:22,355 --> 00:17:23,635
What a terrible child.

219
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:27,161
Bursting in like the entire universe
revolves around him.

220
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:29,471
Not even caring that one false move

221
00:17:29,496 --> 00:17:33,446
could activate the Philosopher's
Stone before it's reached its full potential.

222
00:17:45,935 --> 00:17:49,385
He should be grateful I've allowed him to
live as long as I have.

223
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,030
Master...

224
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,130
The gate...

225
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:54,736
It's still here!

226
00:18:03,209 --> 00:18:03,689
Edward.

227
00:18:05,642 --> 00:18:06,349
Brother?

228
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,820
Alphonse...

229
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:14,779
My automail...

230
00:18:16,667 --> 00:18:17,887
I'm really here.

231
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,780
But does that mean the other Ed had to
die?

232
00:18:21,553 --> 00:18:24,333
his life... traded from mine?

233
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,580
Quite an amazing feat, Edward.

234
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:31,013
Dr. Marcoh?

235
00:18:31,603 --> 00:18:33,513
I never did know where you went.

236
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,440
Sure you did, Ed.

237
00:18:36,894 --> 00:18:42,635
After all, you were the one who found the old Doc and
just waved goodbye as he went into the Führer's custody.

238
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:44,115
Now that was a great idea.

239
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,200
The poor man ended up in that thing's
stomach.

240
00:18:47,966 --> 00:18:50,226
Wouldn't have died if you hadn't tracked
him down.

241
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:54,121
Of course, you were bad luck for a lot of
us, weren't you?

242
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:57,448
I'd still be with my wife, an adorable
little girl, if I hadn't met you.

243
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,152
It must be tough fighting against a friend
that you've already killed once.

244
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:08,835
Is that all you got?

245
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:09,959
Release me.

246
00:19:10,131 --> 00:19:12,132
Impersonations with guilt trips attached?

247
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:13,695
Damn you.

248
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
You'll have to do better than that.

249
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:18,075
You're still a Homunculus under that face.

250
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,600
Have you forgotten what I did to your
friend, Sloth?

251
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,760
I killed her while she was wearing the
face of my own mother.

252
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,269
Really?

253
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,560
That must have been very hard for you.

254
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,411
So, not as tough as you think.

255
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,980
I'd reconsider the use of alchemy if I
were you.

256
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,660
You think I'm going to listen to you?

257
00:19:39,973 --> 00:19:41,673
Go ahead and use it if you want.

258
00:19:41,966 --> 00:19:44,086
It's not like I care what happens to your
brother.

259
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,845
The Philosopher's Stone
has already been activated.

260
00:19:47,095 --> 00:19:50,815
If transmutations occur near him,
who knows what could happen?

261
00:19:51,046 --> 00:19:51,966
Let's find out.

262
00:19:57,227 --> 00:19:58,627
You're going to pay for this!

263
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,399
Keep trying, Ed.

264
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,460
I'm much stronger than you.

265
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:16,185
Don't hurt me, Edward.

266
00:20:16,343 --> 00:20:17,423
Don't mess with me!

267
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,096
Edward, please stop it!

268
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,816
Calm down.

269
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,810
Give up, kid.

270
00:20:24,276 --> 00:20:25,790
You don't have what it takes to kill me.

271
00:20:27,062 --> 00:20:29,503
I don't think you could have picked an
easier target!

272
00:20:30,263 --> 00:20:31,750
Show me what you really look like!

273
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:37,323
Instead of being a coward whose only real
power is to hide behind other people's faces!

274
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,657
Do you really want to see?

275
00:20:42,036 --> 00:20:43,855
Stop jerking me around!

276
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:45,263
You asked for it!

277
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,085
What's wrong?

278
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:53,537
I thought you wanted to see.

279
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,741
Your... His son!

280
00:21:01,734 --> 00:21:07,527
Envy was the very first Homunculi,
created by Hohenheim almost 400 years ago.

281
00:21:07,607 --> 00:21:13,227
The result of the failed human transmutation of
our son, who died prematurely of Mercury poisoning.

282
00:21:13,807 --> 00:21:17,067
I suppose you could say that Envy was once
your brother.

283
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,605
But then he abandoned me.

284
00:21:18,823 --> 00:21:21,403
Started fresh with his perfect wife and
kids.

285
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:24,670
Needless to say, I never did like being
replaced.

286
00:21:40,607 --> 00:21:41,187
Brother?

287
00:21:49,211 --> 00:21:49,645
Edward.

288
00:21:51,745 --> 00:21:52,151
Ed.

289
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,433
EDWARD!!!!!
