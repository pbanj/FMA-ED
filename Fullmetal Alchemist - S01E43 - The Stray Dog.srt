1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,180
This is Resembool?

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,140
Somehow I guess I was
expecting something different.

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,500
Sorry if it's too
rural for your tastes.

4
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:19,644
Is he still looking?

5
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,370
uhh, no.
I don't think so.

6
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,370
He was staring at me
the whole train ride.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,850
He couldn't keep
his eyes off me.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,750
You know what they say.

9
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,970
Beauty is an absolute curse.

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,150
Excuse me, but aren't you...
You're not Sarah, are you?

11
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,170
You've really grown up.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:38,630
Sorry!

13
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,350
You're mistaken!

14
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:48,980
What a creep.

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,460
Pretending to know me like that.

16
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:50,840
Sarah.

17
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,580
Wait a sec.

18
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,080
That was my mother's name.

19
00:01:03,150 --> 00:01:05,570
It's cruel to lie to an
old woman like that.

20
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,770
I thought you were in
Rush Valley studying.

21
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,990
And now you tell me
you've been in Central.

22
00:01:09,991 --> 00:01:11,170
Sorry, Grandma.

23
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:13,770
I didn't mean to lie, but I've
been taking care of Ed and Al.

24
00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,110
I'm sure you were.

25
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,870
But if that's the case, why didn't
you drag them back home with you?

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,990
Well, uh... Hey!

27
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:21,910
I almost forgot.

28
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,606
I met an old friend of
yours in Rush Valley.

29
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,245
Isn't that neat?

30
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:29,830
If somebody asks,
we're not here.

31
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:30,790
You never saw us.

32
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:31,650
Good grief.

33
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:34,810
Just a minute.

34
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,720
He must have followed us here.

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,060
You came back.

36
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,540
Sorry, Pinako.

37
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:50,320
I seem to be having some
trouble finding my old house.

38
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,780
I suppose you realize a lot
has changed since you left.

39
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,740
Wait, Grandma.

40
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,820
You know who this man is?

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,480
You were young.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,580
I'm not surprised you
don't remember him.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,800
Say hello to Ed and
Al's father, Winry.

44
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,340
Winry.

45
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,140
Yes, of course that's your name.

46
00:02:08,141 --> 00:02:09,440
Sorry about the whole mix-up.

47
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,289
It's just been so long,
I guess I got confused.

48
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,560
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,240
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

50
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,720
That is Alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

51
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,200
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

52
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:24,750
How'd you get so fast?

53
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:26,330
Can't we slow down for a bit?

54
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:29,450
My body feels so
light for some reason.

55
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,730
But we can rest for
a while if you're tired.

56
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,590
I've been thinking about
what you said earlier.

57
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,550
It really explains a few things.

58
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,890
You mean Führer Bradley?

59
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,990
And your leader...
the Führer Hes a....

60
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,510
Homunculus!

61
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:55,210
The Military's actions make more
sense with a Homunculus calling the shots.

62
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,930
And he couldn't do that
just by impersonating him.

63
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,090
Besides, I had a run-in
with the Führer's secretary.

64
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,090
The one who's
always by his side.

65
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,770
She's a Homunculus too.

66
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,870
Brother, you know
what that means.

67
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:07,730
Drop it.

68
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:13,050
But teacher told us a Homunculus is born
when someone fails a human transmutation.

69
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:14,590
I said drop it, Al!

70
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:28,519
Al...

71
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,340
What was that place?

72
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,020
The giant gate.

73
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,480
I... I suddenly remember
seeing it before.

74
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,320
It felt... it felt
like the truth.

75
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,880
According to teacher, it's not.

76
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,860
Forget about it, Al.

77
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,940
But how did we summon it?

78
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,620
All we did was touch.

79
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,820
I'm an Alchemist.

80
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,320
Maybe I just subconsciously
activated the stone somehow.

81
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,940
I can't say for sure.

82
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,733
You don't really think I've been turned
into the Philosopher's Stone, do you?

83
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,000
Really?

84
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,640
The stone is this legendary thing,
with supposedly unlimited power.

85
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,028
How could that be me?

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,560
Nothing's impossible, Al.

87
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,316
We don't know what we're dealing
with, and we don't know how it works yet.

88
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,640
You should try not to
touch me for the time being.

89
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,660
But... but why?

90
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,796
If we come into contact again,
we could use the stone's power.

91
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,336
And if you're the stone, what
happens when your power's gone?

92
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,440
I could lose you, and I'm
not gonna take that risk.

93
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,400
So what are we doing now?

94
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,940
We're going to Resembool.

95
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,776
That's the first place
the state will look for us.

96
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,200
I know, but those Homunculi are
a bigger problem for us right now.

97
00:06:36,035 --> 00:06:39,240
And if we're gonna fight them,
there's something I need first.

98
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:58,516
I've talked with some
of the soldiers, sir.

99
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,000
They say Kimbley was found
dead before the red light appeared.

100
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,242
Apparently Scar was the one who killed
him, and Archer ordered a full assault.

101
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,800
The civilians seem to have fled
before the Military invasion, Colonel.

102
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,315
The entire city was empty
when the troops arrived.

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,760
We found the secret
passage out of Lior.

104
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:14,300
We've sent a
squad to investigate.

105
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,420
The military's
assumptions were wrong.

106
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,995
They never planned to resist.

107
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,282
That was Scar's plan all along.

108
00:07:20,355 --> 00:07:23,132
He lured us here to use our
soldiers as ingredients for his Alchemy.

109
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,980
The Elric brothers
are still alive.

110
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:29,100
Several soldiers spotted them on the outskirts
of town, but their current location is unknown.

111
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,560
They were last seen over
an hour ago, leaving the area.

112
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,860
That's all we know.

113
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,320
You don't think the Elrics would
have condoned this, do you?

114
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,840
Considering Ed's warning, I don't
think he was part of Scar's plan.

115
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,100
Not intentionally, anyway.

116
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,420
Colonel.

117
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:52,720
So far, we have 28 confirmed dead
and 67 injured, including five officers.

118
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,000
There's another
900 still missing.

119
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,340
I assure you, we won't rest until
we've gotten to the bottom of this.

120
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,920
And that is clearly not going to
happen until you find the one responsible.

121
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:03,380
Scar.

122
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,720
I know, sir.

123
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,120
No Mustang.

124
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,800
I mean Fullmetal.

125
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,940
Can you tell me why the Elric
brothers showed up in Lior?

126
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,260
We believe they were
in pursuit of Scar, sir.

127
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:17,600
And why would they
have been doing that?

128
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,680
Have they been given
orders to capture him?

129
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:20,720
Not directly.

130
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,240
They were given orders to conduct an
Alchemy investigation on a large scale.

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:28,220
So acting on their own, these skilled
Alchemists meet up with a fugitive in a war zone.

132
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,280
Resulting in an alchemic explosion that
takes the lives of countless numbers of soldiers.

133
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,060
You're going to put a noose around their necks
already before we even know what happened?

134
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,520
I believe we should give them a chance
to explain their actions themselves, sir.

135
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,160
An official interrogation,
Colonel Mustang?

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,540
Very well.

137
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:50,540
But I should warn you that if you let those suspects
get away from us, you'll be doing the explaining to me.

138
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:51,700
Go.

139
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:52,688
Ensure their success.

140
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,940
I've heard some very
disturbing reports.

141
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,780
According to my information, the Elric
brothers may be fighting alongside those

142
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,534
who call themselves Homunculi.

143
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Capture them, Mustang.

144
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,340
If they won't go peacefully,
then take them out by force.

145
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,700
You're to consider
them enemy combatants.

146
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,340
Colonel... You heard
what the man said.

147
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,040
I want a report on all sightings of
the Elrics at the time of the incident.

148
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,260
I can't believe we're
hunting down Ed.

149
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,240
It's messed up.

150
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,860
Those are the orders, Fury.

151
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,540
But Scar's to blame
for this, not the Elrics.

152
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,180
And what about that
rampage that Archer went on?

153
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,020
If anyone should be under
investigation, it's that creep.

154
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,919
It is suspicious that they ran away, and if
we don't find them, the Colonel gets punished.

155
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:43,875
Did he really mean we should
kill them if they don't surrender?

156
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,200
Shall we get started, Colonel?

157
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:47,620
Yes.

158
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,460
You spent the
night out here again?

159
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,920
Thanks for waking me.

160
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,220
I could have slept all day.

161
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,960
I've been losing track of time.

162
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Tell me, when did Trisha die?

163
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,200
It's been six long years.

164
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,240
I see.

165
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,000
The boys must have
been torn up over their loss.

166
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,240
My God, I've done it twice.

167
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,740
I was thinking you
were Sarah again.

168
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,757
You must have been
good friends with her.

169
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,280
I guess memories don't age.

170
00:11:06,245 --> 00:11:07,940
Sara was my mom,
and a great one at that.

171
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,300
So much pain.

172
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,620
All because of that damn war.

173
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,800
I can't imagine
what it was like there.

174
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,040
Supposedly my parents, they were
executed by the military they went to help.

175
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,420
All because they were treating the
wounded Ishbalans the same way.

176
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,140
How sad we are.

177
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,600
You can't sum this
up with one word.

178
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,280
It's a lot more than just sad.

179
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
When I was little, I'd imagine the
people who killed my parents as demons.

180
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,080
But now I know the men who
did it, and I respect him somehow.

181
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,640
I feel lost.

182
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,463
I don't know how to make
sense of all this anymore.

183
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,060
There's no good reason.

184
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:51,680
We're all lost.

185
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,180
That's why we're sad.

186
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,230
Winry, you're back!

187
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,770
Oh, I'm so glad!

188
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,430
I'm starving!

189
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,390
Ah!

190
00:12:19,391 --> 00:12:20,450
Lieutenant Ross?

191
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,690
And don't forget Sergeant Block!

192
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,230
So you followed us!

193
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,731
I knew we saw something
we shouldn't have!

194
00:12:26,755 --> 00:12:28,490
And now we're gonna
die because of it!

195
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:30,090
Oh, please spare
our lives, I beg you!

196
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,226
I knew I shouldn't have
gotten involved with the Military!

197
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,750
I should have
listened to my mom!

198
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,880
Would you calm down?

199
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,460
Hey!

200
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,110
Those poor boys.

201
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,110
I didn't know their
home was gone, too.

202
00:12:51,111 --> 00:12:53,390
You said the Military
is after them now.

203
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,710
What are they accused of?

204
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,750
All that we know is an
emergency bulletin was sent out.

205
00:12:57,995 --> 00:13:01,350
The Führer has ordered that he wants
the Fullmetal Alchemist and his brother

206
00:13:01,351 --> 00:13:04,630
captured, even killed if that's what it
takes, saying they've been implicated in

207
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:07,110
some kind of major offensive
against the Military in Lior.

208
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:08,470
Oh, man.

209
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,390
What are they up to now?

210
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,710
A friend of ours is a
communications officer.

211
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,727
He told us that a special search
team is being organized under

212
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,170
General Hakuro's command,
and they'll probably come here.

213
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:21,390
It's safe to assume the local
police have been told to find them as well.

214
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,370
The next thing I know, the Lieutenant
here says we're taking a little vacation.

215
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:27,050
I thought she was romancing me.

216
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:29,756
I thought you'd be happy
to get out of the city for once.

217
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:33,110
I can't believe you did all this to
get information to a wanted criminal.

218
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,930
What are you saying?

219
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,166
Regardless of what the Führer
says, I know those two aren't traitors.

220
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:40,290
And I'll do whatever
I can to help them.

221
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:41,210
Okay, okay.

222
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,586
I appreciate that, but I'm not sure
if they're coming back here or not.

223
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:45,530
Hm.

224
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,870
I'm sure they'll come back.

225
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,070
They may not have a house with
four walls, but this place is

226
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,725
still their home, I know that.

227
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:54,750
And besides, you're here.

228
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,650
I can remember a time when
no railroads led to this place.

229
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,350
There wasn't so much as a single dirt road
connecting this tiny little village to the eastern frontier.

230
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,668
To get to the east, you had to traverse that
mountain, relying on the river to lead you there.

231
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,170
I know that stream.

232
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,590
We used to play
there a lot as kids.

233
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:16,970
I get it.

234
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:19,070
Etta now will have to
come that way to get here.

235
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,110
Thanks for the tip, old man.

236
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,830
Old man.

237
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:23,070
Let's go, Sheska.

238
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,430
You guys wait here.

239
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:27,930
If the search party gets
here, I'll try to stall them, okay?

240
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,050
Thanks!

241
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:35,850
But it's been over a hundred years since
the first railroad was built through here.

242
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,640
What's wrong?

243
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,180
Just get down and stay quiet.

244
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,260
I don't think it's worth it.

245
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,117
Betraying those kids
for our own careers.

246
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,120
We're not doing
this for us, Breda.

247
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:06,140
I know.

248
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,120
We're doing it for the Colonel, so
he doesn't take the blame for Lior.

249
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,205
Why do you think I'm
trudging through this forest?

250
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,020
The Colonel?

251
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,223
Well, if he has to go
down for this, then so be it.

252
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:22,990
Hey, Ed.

253
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,370
It's uh nice to see you again.

254
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,725
We'll have to give
the Colonel his credit.

255
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:29,324
He told us you'd take this
old shortcut to get back home.

256
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,490
Look, no hard feelings.

257
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:35,970
I'm not going.

258
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,190
Ed, please.

259
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,230
I'm not a military dog anymore.

260
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,500
Go ahead and fire.

261
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,020
When that bullet ricochets off my
hand, who do you think gets hurt?

262
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,020
Ed, please.

263
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,820
Don't do this.

264
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,780
Go ahead.

265
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,140
Shoot.

266
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,760
Stop it!

267
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:01,800
Havoc?

268
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,760
I'm really sorry, but I had to.

269
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,180
Al, now.

270
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,140
I'm sorry.

271
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,560
Stop right there, Ed!

272
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,600
Edward!

273
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,180
If you have anything you
want to say, well, listen.

274
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
We're not your enemy here.

275
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,020
We're trying to help you out.

276
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,186
To tell your side of it
all in the investigation.

277
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,560
This should work for now.

278
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,340
I wonder if the Elric brothers are actually
prepared to fight us to the end on this.

279
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:41,440
We'll know when
we reach the end.

280
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,240
That was pitiful.

281
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,820
Let's get them next time.

282
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:48,820
Colonel, would you mind
grabbing my cigarettes for me?

283
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,780
Get well soon, Havoc.

284
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,680
How much ground do you think they've
covered while we've been down, sir?

285
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,180
Not too much, considering
Al can't risk getting in water.

286
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,660
Since his blood
seal could wash off.

287
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:19,537
Stop Screaming.

288
00:17:21,666 --> 00:17:24,066
I promise I have this under control.

289
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,710
Tell us the truth, girls.

290
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,170
Who tipped you off
about the Elric brothers?

291
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,290
Nobody.

292
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:45,990
And don't talk to us about truth, not when
you think Ed and Al could really be traitors.

293
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,970
We won't know that until we've
captured and questioned them.

294
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,010
Aren't you going to speak?

295
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,590
You're the one who got
them into this in the first place.

296
00:17:57,430 --> 00:17:58,370
It's no use.

297
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:01,550
He doesn't care about anything except
the bars and stripes on his uniform.

298
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:02,730
Tell me, Roy.

299
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:05,970
Was this the kind of devotion you
had when you killed my mom and dad?

300
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:20,790
What?

301
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,290
I told you, Al.

302
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:22,907
We can't touch.

303
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,435
We don't know
what it could trigger.

304
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,350
You know running
makes you look guilty.

305
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:52,730
Ed!

306
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:53,170
Al!

307
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,070
Winry?

308
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,070
We're running because we
knew you'd come after us.

309
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,570
Isn't that what every dog
does when it's chased?

310
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:04,890
Yes, but a trained dog never
defies the orders of its owner.

311
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,530
Then I'm a stray.

312
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:07,230
Really?

313
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,810
Then maybe we'll
have to put you down.

314
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,230
Just come with us, Edward, okay?

315
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,790
We're not out to hurt you.

316
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:16,070
We just want to get to the
bottom of what happened in Lior.

317
00:19:20,985 --> 00:19:21,947
I'll never go back there.

318
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,690
You'll have to kill me first.

319
00:19:23,691 --> 00:19:24,230
So what?

320
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,290
You're going to shirk off responsibilities
and revert to a stubborn child?

321
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,510
Say what you want.

322
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm in control now!

323
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,670
Good luck making sparks now.

324
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,350
Al!

325
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,270
Major.

326
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:40,390
Sir.

327
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:03,870
I used my Alchemy to transmit
the rock into a hollow projectile.

328
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,770
Then I heat the air inside to
explode it into a hundred daggers.

329
00:20:06,771 --> 00:20:09,050
It's an effective
attack, don't you think?

330
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:12,570
Yeah, I'm sure the two of
you put it to great use in Ishbal.

331
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,360
What do we do?

332
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:47,871
Stop!

333
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,540
Please.

334
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,000
Just stop.

335
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,200
Winry?

336
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,960
I once executed two people.

337
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,520
Two doctors.

338
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,040
There are no sides.

339
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,160
Just patients.

340
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,060
That's what they said as they
treated our fallen enemies in Ishbal.

341
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:17,060
But the people they were healing
would just rise up again to fight us.

342
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,680
The Military asked them to stop.

343
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,180
But they wouldn't.

344
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,760
And their makeshift hospital was
becoming a den for insurgents.

345
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,280
I got my orders in the morning.

346
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:28,780
And I shot them.

347
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:29,880
That night.

348
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,160
Afterwards I
tried to kill myself.

349
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,040
But I was too much of a coward.

350
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,960
So I took an oath instead.

351
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,120
To never follow unreasonable
commands again.

352
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,740
To reach a position where I
wouldn't have to follow them.

353
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,560
And I've stayed true to that.

354
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,580
I'm not chasing you
because I was commanded to.

355
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,640
I'm doing it because I'm pissed.

356
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,180
Now why the hell did you two run
away without asking for my help first?!

357
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,569
Fullmetal Alchemist

358
00:23:40,993 --> 00:23:43,410
Episode 44,
Hohenheim of Light.

359
00:23:45,164 --> 00:23:47,864
What the hell do you
think you're doing here?

360
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,590
You've got some nerve showing
up again after all this time!
