1
00:00:07,862 --> 00:00:09,342
Alright, how did it come to this?

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,840
How long are we going to stand around
doing nothing?

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:13,640
I thought we had a war to fight.

4
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,100
Hell if I know, man.

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,240
Of course there are bound to be a few stubborn
holdouts and Bradley loyalists who refuse to cooperate.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,084
It'll no doubt be an arduous battle, but I will try
my hardest to keep the death toll to a minimum.

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,520
We're reversing course and moving back
towards Central immediately.

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,440
You can't be serious.

9
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,700
Together we'll boldly lead our divisions
in storming Central headquarters.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,200
You mean staging a coup?

11
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:55,680
You think we'll betray our Führer just
like that?

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,860
The Führer has betrayed us by making immoral decisions
while allowing those around him to manipulate his judgment.

13
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,340
We are acting for the good of the state.

14
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,960
But, sir, is there proof to these charges?

15
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,640
Proof?

16
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:11,560
Your proof is right here!

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:16,480
See this body, flawlessly sculpted in
service of our state?

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,900
Feel how they pulse with loyalty,
how solid and serious they are?

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,040
Feel how?

20
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,280
If you don't believe me, they'll make
you believe!

21
00:01:24,668 --> 00:01:25,068
Feel!

22
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:28,480
The Philosopher's Stone.

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,760
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange and

24
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:40,110
alchemy, may gain without sacrifice,
create without equal exchange.

25
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,220
We searched for it.

26
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,080
And we found it.

27
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,024
Mommy?

28
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,420
I've started a chain reaction that's
transforming your liquid body into ethanol.

29
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:56,490
Nicely done, sweetheart.

30
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:10,120
Clean up after yourselves and take care of
each other.

31
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:51,856
Edward!

32
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:52,929
Alphonse!

33
00:04:56,691 --> 00:04:57,499
Winry, is that you?

34
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,210
What are you doing here?

35
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,950
Did something bad happen?

36
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,630
I came cause I was worried about you,
but I see that you finally beat her.

37
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,050
You are not Winry Rockbell.

38
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,310
Alphonse, you're the one I've always
loved!

39
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:21,390
Well, that was easy.

40
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,530
You're too late!

41
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,530
I am the Philosopher's Stone!

42
00:05:25,225 --> 00:05:26,340
Yeah, that's what I've heard.

43
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,150
Why don't I give the new you a test drive?

44
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:33,290
Now that you've become the stone, let's
see how much your cute little seal job can take.

45
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,630
Leave my brother alone, you bastard!

46
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,070
I know how you love being protective.

47
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,450
But you don't have to blow a gasket,
I'm just taking him back to my master.

48
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:47,750
Your master?

49
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,450
That must be the one Lust talked about.

50
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,890
She said this master's only using you to
get the Philosopher's Stone and achieve

51
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:57,550
immortality without concern for you
Homunculi.

52
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,450
Who cares?

53
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,810
And you shouldn't speak so impersonally.

54
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:02,350
You and my master go way back.

55
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,990
Your master knew about our mom's
Homunculus from the start.

56
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,990
Sought her out and fed her red stones so
she'd live.

57
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,110
Who else would do that
except... Don't say it, Ed!

58
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,590
Dad would never do that!

59
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,230
Never!

60
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:17,430
We've talked enough.

61
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,050
Hey, I'm on your side, remember?

62
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,464
You're supposed to be tackling that
half-pine over there!

63
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,750
But he can do anything now, can't he?

64
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,530
Sorry, kid, but this toy isn't for you to
play with.

65
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,810
He could bring Mommy back!

66
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,855
You have to let me try!

67
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,090
You have to!

68
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,290
Give it a rest, mama's boy!

69
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,810
This is all because of you.

70
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,370
It's your fault that Mommy's gone!

71
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,410
Easy!

72
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,210
Mommy!

73
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:51,970
Mommy!

74
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:52,630
Mommy!

75
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:56,190
She was your mommy, too, and you killed
her!

76
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,770
Stop it!

77
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:09,180
This has nothing to do with you!

78
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,980
If there's anyone you should want to kill,
it should be me, my child.

79
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,800
No, you're not my mom!

80
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,000
You're absolutely nothing to me!

81
00:07:19,001 --> 00:07:19,309
Teacher!

82
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,330
Are you okay?

83
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,050
He was... crying.

84
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,710
While I can't even squeeze out a single
tear.

85
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,470
That poor kid's crying like a baby.

86
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,110
Like he... he was crying because I
couldn't.

87
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:51,830
Enough.

88
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:52,910
Let's find Al.

89
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:56,450
I can't do much in this shape,
but I could sure as hell be a crutch.

90
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:57,910
Now, where to?

91
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,670
Brother, can we go?

92
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:14,110
Okay, but aren't these central bookstores
great?

93
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:15,990
I've never even heard of some of these
books.

94
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:16,630
Whoa.

95
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,930
I've been looking for this forever.

96
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,270
I hope we get to see Ed and Al.

97
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,950
Either pay or get out.

98
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,050
Crap.

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,822
If I spend all our money here,
we won't have anything left for a hotel.

100
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,310
But if I don't buy these books now,
I may never have another chance.

101
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,310
Start a tab.

102
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,290
No can do.

103
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:39,370
We're a specialty store that caters to State Alchemists,
and only they can establish lines of credit with us.

104
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:41,528
They're the only ones who can understand
these anyway.

105
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:42,110
Uh...

106
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:46,010
Then it's a good thing I am, in fact,
a State Alchemist.

107
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,530
Huh?

108
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,610
Guess you don't recognize me.

109
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,340
Brother!

110
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,680
So this is the infamous Edward Elric?

111
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,400
Yeah, the little traitor told me himself.

112
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,960
He's the Fullmetal Alchemist.

113
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:03,800
Wait a minute!

114
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:04,822
You've got the wrong guy!

115
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
I was just borrowing his identity to get
some books!

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,654
Yeah, tell it to the people at
headquarters.

117
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,356
Our orders are to bring you and your
brother there for detainment.

118
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,500
Brother, what's happening?

119
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,100
Just get out of here!

120
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,076
It's the younger brother!

121
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,023
Grab him before he runs!

122
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,660
Get back here!

123
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,240
Hold him!

124
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,140
Stay still!

125
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,080
Stop it!

126
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,260
Was the younger brother always this small?

127
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,560
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

128
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,309
What'd you do this time, brother?

129
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,340
I don't think I like Central very much.

130
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,170
Lust.

131
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,110
Did you seal one of the Homunculi in that
circle?

132
00:09:41,990 --> 00:09:42,798
I didn't do this one.

133
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,190
It must have been...

134
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,030
Regardless, this means there are four of
them left.

135
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,610
The child.

136
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,670
The one who eats everything.

137
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,570
The one who can morph into anyone.

138
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,250
And the Führer.

139
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,130
And one more.

140
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,930
The one who controls them all.

141
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,790
Who's there?

142
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,130
Look, Nina.

143
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:05,930
That's your friend Ed there.

144
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,030
Edward, your friend.

145
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:08,830
Say hello, dear.

146
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:09,790
Don't be shy.

147
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:14,730
Even with the stone, he couldn't make her
soul.

148
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,410
Why don't you play in the courtyard?

149
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,510
I bet Alexander's lonely.

150
00:10:19,511 --> 00:10:20,730
Which reminds me.

151
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:21,770
Where is that dog?

152
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:23,550
Where's Alexander gone?

153
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,090
Some watchdog, huh?

154
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,970
And you're fine with this?

155
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:30,410
That soulless doll is the embodiment of
his sins.

156
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,350
Just like Sloth represented my sin.

157
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:36,130
And Wrath yours.

158
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,650
Don't worry, Nina.

159
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,250
Daddy will keep you safe.

160
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,730
You've really grown up, Edward.

161
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,093
Crap, grown up?

162
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:49,370
I thought I'd grown up when I was
certified as a State Alchemist.

163
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:51,850
But obviously, I still had a long way to
go from there.

164
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,590
So what do we do now?

165
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:02,010
Well, as I see it, there's only one of the
Homunculi left that we can account for.

166
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,130
And we know where to find.

167
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:06,390
I take it you're talking about the big
one, Führer Bradley.

168
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,410
What's taking so long?

169
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,393
Quit dragging your feet!

170
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,960
We're completely surrounded.

171
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,680
And there are fewer soldiers cooperating
with us than we hoped.

172
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,340
Well, don't tell me you're surprised.

173
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:35,560
The Führer's rule has made the army
powerful.

174
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,140
There aren't many officers who will want
to betray him.

175
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,900
Looks like the newly appointed Brigadier
General finally made a wrong move.

176
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,120
Not at all.

177
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:48,400
Mustang's real plan is for us to create a standoff,
forcing them to come to us, leaving Central undefended.

178
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,940
We're going to have to dig in.

179
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,700
But I can't do this!

180
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,600
How am I supposed to lead our troops in
fending off a major siege?

181
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,952
I'm just a freaking Lieutenant!

182
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,720
You have nothing to worry about.

183
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,500
I'll be with you every step of the way.

184
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,300
Though I must say, the two of you have
never looked better.

185
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,980
Lieutenant Havok, you're supposed to be in
bed.

186
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,560
You good at keeping secrets, sweetheart?

187
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,240
General Mustang, what's this about?

188
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:19,422
Some kind of secret mission?

189
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,140
Yes, in fact, it is.

190
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,820
So keep your mouth shut, okay?

191
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,440
Can you do that?

192
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,680
Of course.

193
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,400
What are you so angry about now?

194
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,420
I'm not angry.

195
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,269
Just leave it alone.

196
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,280
It looks like Havok and company are
holding up their end of the plan.

197
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,100
Yeah.

198
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,520
Hurry up, men!

199
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,294
Let's look alive!

200
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,740
We have to catch up to Mustang's mutinous
brigade by nightfall, so step two!

201
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,360
I'm impressed you could assemble such a
fine expeditionary force on such short notice.

202
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:55,196
Why, thank you, but I couldn't have done
it without your advice.

203
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,340
How were you able to anticipate this
treasonous insurrection, sir?

204
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,960
That Mustang and Armstrong
would turn on you as soon as they

205
00:13:00,961 --> 00:13:03,320
were given new stars for their
lapels and troops to command?

206
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:08,300
At least now we know their true character and that
they were up to no good all along, just like Basque Grand.

207
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,420
Well, you see, I had to make it seem as
though I trusted Mustang.

208
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,640
That's why I promoted him to Brigadier
General.

209
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,580
I'm sure you weren't pleased with that
promotion at the time.

210
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,380
I trusted your judgment.

211
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,480
And believe me, sir, I'll have this
mission done in no time.

212
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,740
So, can I punch out for the day?

213
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,080
Oh?

214
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,029
You arrested a couple of kids calling
themselves the Elric brothers this morning?

215
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,620
Well, let's see.

216
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,040
Yes, I think you'd better execute them.

217
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,300
Why did you have to pretend to be Ed
again?

218
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,780
What else could I have done?

219
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,720
We're broke.

220
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,980
But we have to get out and go see them and
give them the page from Dad's journal.

221
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,400
Quick, hide it!

222
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:10,660
Thanks a lot.

223
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,643
You've outdone yourself.

224
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,680
No problem.

225
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,720
And since this job is for the Führer himself,
I made sure to finish it as fast as possible.

226
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,440
So everything's exactly like this
blueprint?

227
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,440
Oh yeah, I followed every detail,
just like you told me.

228
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:25,160
There's just one thing that struck me as a
little odd.

229
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,260
Usually you'd want a wine cellar to be...

230
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,060
Yeah, I don't get it either.

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,931
I just gave you the instructions that I
got from the Führer's secretary.

232
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,760
I'm filling in for her while she's on
vacation.

233
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:41,260
Since I asked you to do such a quick job, I
threw in a special thank you for your hard work.

234
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,500
Oh, is that so?

235
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,420
These thank yous are putting my kid
through college.

236
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:55,940
The construction is all finished, and if I
have my dates right, he's going home today.

237
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,820
Something wrong?

238
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,680
It says here the Elric brothers were
arrested this morning.

239
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,640
Shouldn't you have checked if Bradley was
here before we invaded?

240
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:14,916
Oh sure, it's my fault!

241
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,755
How was I supposed to know he'd go home
early for his kid's birthday?

242
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,160
There they are!

243
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,500
Quit making excuses!

244
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,260
Let it go!

245
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,500
I know they came around the corner.

246
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:31,116
Where'd they go?

247
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:34,360
I hope you're not injured, Fullmetal.

248
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,940
It's you guys, the impostors!

249
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
I have a name, Russell Tringham!

250
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,188
They were arrested because the MPs thought
they were you and your brother.

251
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:45,260
I honestly don't know how they get
confused.

252
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,196
You're only about half as tall as I am.

253
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,120
What did you say?!

254
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,120
Is it me or did you shrink since we last
met?

255
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,860
But brother, none of this would have happened
if you didn't keep pretending to be Ed.

256
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:55,053
Without even hesitating, the Führer
ordered them to be Executed.

257
00:15:55,900 --> 00:16:00,106
We thought that was too extreme a
sentence, so we went to talk to them ourselves.

258
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,540
And then you helped them escape when we
burst in and caused all this noise.

259
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,785
They're here somewhere!

260
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,620
We'll hurry up and find them!

261
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:10,520
In all seriousness, it was good seeing you
again, but we have to get going now.

262
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,320
Where to?

263
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,320
We're going to pay the Führer a little
house call.

264
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,720
We have no other choice.

265
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,260
Oh yeah, I almost forgot!

266
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:21,740
Take this.

267
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,160
It's an excerpt from our father's old
journal.

268
00:16:24,161 --> 00:16:26,400
There's some information about Central
that you might want.

269
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,060
Teacher!

270
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,800
This means...

271
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,817
But you can't be....

272
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,804
Lieutenant Colonel Archer

273
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:00,260
Edward Elric and the woman who escaped
from South Headquarters.

274
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,260
I've been looking for you.

275
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,420
Leave the tank head to me.

276
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,540
You go to the place mentioned in that
journal.

277
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,880
Teacher... If you're going to keep
calling me that, then do what I say.

278
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,440
Now go!

279
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,440
You boys get out of here too!

280
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,320
It looks like the Elric brothers won't be
needing us to bail them out today after all.

281
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,336
I knew they wouldn't let themselves get
caught without a reason.

282
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,080
Those boys are smarter than that.

283
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,400
We'd better move.

284
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,420
Hey!

285
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,520
I need your car!

286
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Well, I'll be damned.

287
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:54,940
Mustang...

288
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,075
Did you come here to capture us too?

289
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,215
Then where were you headed when you ran
into me, General?

290
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
The Wog District.

291
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,800
That's where the Führer has his private
estate.

292
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,200
Going to wish his kid a happy birthday?

293
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,280
I gotcha it's top secret.

294
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,720
But you should know they'll be ready for
you.

295
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,240
Armstrong staged a coup for me on the
Northern Front.

296
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,820
The Führer would never imagine that I'd be
right back here under his nose in Central.

297
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:31,540
I thought you were all about following orders and
kissing ass so you could become Führer one day.

298
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,280
Wait a minute.

299
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,560
That's not fair.

300
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,560
You became a military dog too so you could
chase your own goals.

301
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,860
So don't go... Take it easy.

302
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:43,600
The end justifies the means when it comes
to achieving my ultimate goal.

303
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,600
Back then, that just seemed like the right
stance for me to take.

304
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,720
You realize there'll be no justification in the
eyes of the public if you go against the Führer.

305
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:56,224
Even if you pull this off, you'll never be
allowed to succeed him with your reputation.

306
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,180
The masses won't hear of it.

307
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,600
That may be, but even so... I can't
let him get away with what he's done.

308
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,980
So you're doing all this to avenge Hughes?

309
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,260
You got it.

310
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:10,640
He must have known what was going on in
the military and that's why he was killed.

311
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,520
And for that, you're willing to throw away
everything you've worked for your entire career?

312
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,840
Without a second thought.

313
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,920
Not so different from you, is it?

314
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:22,460
Selflessly giving up your status as State
Alchemist for your brother's sake.

315
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,600
Like adults, we swallowed the crap they
fed us and now we're throwing it all aside.

316
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:27,900
Funny.

317
00:19:27,901 --> 00:19:30,120
Us both trying to live out our dreams.

318
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,380
Like children.

319
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,240
I can't let you come with me.

320
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,740
Even after I became a soldier,
war still seemed like something that

321
00:19:41,741 --> 00:19:44,220
happened in a far-off land where I
couldn't see it.

322
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:45,936
Where someone else fought and died.

323
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,920
It didn't seem real.

324
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,840
I thought war had nothing to do with me.

325
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,340
But now that I've learned there's someone
who's willing to start war, who's going to.

326
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:57,480
start war just for the stone... I know that as long as
there are people who seek the

327
00:19:57,481 --> 00:19:59,976
stones forbidden power that bloodshed
will keep happening.

328
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,700
And I know the desire for that power lurks
somewhere in all of us.

329
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:10,460
The Homunculi may throw fuel on the fire of war, but didn't
the desire to bring back people that we love create them?

330
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,540
And if they're nothing more than products
of our hearts and minds, no matter how

331
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:20,640
pure our intentions, then there will never be a war
that isn't at least in some part caused by all of us.

332
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,180
Never.

333
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,820
But you're thinking on too large a scale
there, kid.

334
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,000
If we don't want to drive ourselves crazy, each of
us can only deal with what's directly in front of us.

335
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,986
But what's in front of me is to defeat the
one the Homunculi call their master.

336
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:40,470
After that, I'll destroy the Philosopher's
Stone once and for all, so its whole

337
00:20:40,471 --> 00:20:43,290
existence will be permanently erased from
mankind's memory.

338
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,810
And no one will ever hunger for its power
again.

339
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:46,990
Wait, destroy?

340
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:50,250
So I take it that means the Philosopher's
Stone has been completed.

341
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,510
I'm guessing it's the one Scar was working
on.

342
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:55,310
In the end, it wasn't just Scar who forged
the Philosopher's Stone.

343
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:57,230
It was in our own hearts, all of us.

344
00:20:57,231 --> 00:20:59,370
But wasn't that your dream all along?

345
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,390
To one day use the stone to get back what
you and your brother lost?

346
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:07,090
All of that would mean nothing if it came
at the expense of so much pain.

347
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:12,690
Then there's something more important than
that?

348
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:17,470
Even when our eyes are closed,
there's a whole world out there that lives

349
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:19,230
outside ourselves and our dreams.

350
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,283
Goodbye, Fullmetal.

351
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,180
Goodbye, General.

352
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,230
Fullmetal Alchemist

353
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,530

354
