1
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:06,133
I'm sorry to have to bother
you with this, Colonel, but here.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,661
This comes directly
from Ed Elric.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,825
An invoice?

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:20,025
He wants Eastern Headquarters
to reimburse him for everything.

5
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:23,787
Hospitalization, medication,
travel, and other assorted expenses.

6
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:27,505
Junk food.

7
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,665
Literature.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,145
And an awful lot of unexplained
receipts from toy stores.

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,565
And now where are they?

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:43,265
A trip.

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,265
They're searching for a different
method to restore their bodies.

12
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:49,166
They'll contact us when
they're ready, Colonel, sir.

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:49,965
Sorry.

14
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,385
I'm asking where they went!

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:56,085
Colonel, look here.

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,625
Take me to the Elrics right now!

17
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:05,345
They're gone.

18
00:01:05,605 --> 00:01:06,665
Where are they?

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,765
Just who... Who are you?

20
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:09,365
Hey.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:11,425
Huh.

22
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,226
Good job, honey.

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,065
Let's go.

24
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:26,275
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,935
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

26
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:33,415
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,815
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

28
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,176
I can't believe it!

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,335
Rush Valley!

30
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:31,755
Perfect!

31
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,796
It's the latest design
for Roomie Studios!

32
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,940
I didn't think it'd be here!

33
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:36,675
Look at the size of that rock!

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,755
Will you buy it for me, please?

35
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:40,515
Oh, you bet, baby!

36
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,735
It's perfect!

37
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,235
The latest design
from God's Auto Mail!

38
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:47,595
And will you look at the
precision of those lines?

39
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,895
I have to have it!

40
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,095
Oh, that is so cool!

41
00:04:03,105 --> 00:04:04,555
Oh, that's so cool!

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,435
Let me try it on.

43
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,456
You can't.

44
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,375
And why not?

45
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,736
A high-powered culverin's a
weapon that's meant for a fighter's arm.

46
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,955
A young girl like
you has no use for it.

47
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,715
Oh, am I stooping low.

48
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,535
This place is a real dump.

49
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,755
Pops, give me the
strongest piece you've got.

50
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,415
I just inherited a fortune from my
dead grandma, so money's no object.

51
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,795
Don't ignore a paying customer.

52
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,495
Hey, what you got there?

53
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,055
That looks pretty awesome.

54
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,020
Wrap it up.

55
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:38,675
It's sold.

56
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,695
Not to you.

57
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,802
I only make Automail as a necessity,
not as a rich kid's toy.

58
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,335
Isn't my money as
good as some cripple's?

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:50,815
You don't need this weapon,
kid, and you never will.

60
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,516
You're right, I don't need this.

61
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,575
Not from a washed-up
chump like you.

62
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,356
I don't know what I was thinking coming
into this second-rate junk shop to begin with.

63
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,535
Your stuff's all crap.

64
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,900
Step right up!

65
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:18,200
Rush Valley's famous Automail
arm wrestling competition returns!

66
00:05:18,201 --> 00:05:22,176
The entry fees are measly 10,000 cens,
and if you can beat the reigning champ,

67
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,255
you win the jackpot!

68
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,796
Come on up!

69
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,975
Don't miss your chance!

70
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,595
Excuse me.

71
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,255
I want a piece of that.

72
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,915
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a challenger!

73
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,255
This should be good.

74
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,235
Ready... fight!

75
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,795
Ready... fight!

76
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,800
Brother, was that...?

77
00:05:56,801 --> 00:05:57,395
Yeah.

78
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,795
Ready... fight!

79
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,915
Guess it's to be expected.

80
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,416
Hey, little girl.

81
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,895
You sure you want to do
this with that piece of junk?

82
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:14,795
If it was made by that old man, she'd probably
have a better chance just using her real arm.

83
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,455
I want to see a
good, clean fight!

84
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,415
Ready... fight!

85
00:06:53,515 --> 00:06:55,015
Very Close.

86
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:57,705
If you want, I'll give you the
name of a good mechanic.

87
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:05,965
Is there no one else who
dares to challenge the champ?

88
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:07,605
What about you, sir?

89
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,885
Sure, you look big and strong,
but how'd you like to prove it?

90
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,145
You mean me?

91
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:12,886
No.

92
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,006
No, thank you.

93
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:14,825
That's too bad.

94
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:16,525
What about...

95
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:20,405
No, I couldn't possibly ask this
shrimp to take on the champ.

96
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,205
I'm not a shrimp!

97
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:26,586
Whoa, you're a pretty
feisty shrimp, aren't you?

98
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:30,125
But it looks like you salvaged that
Automail from the bottom of a scrap heap.

99
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,005
Alphonse, let go
of your brother.

100
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,785
Yes, ma'am.

101
00:07:42,015 --> 00:07:44,715
Edward if you lose, I'll kick your ass!

102
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,695
Wrestlers, take your stances.

103
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,215
Ready... fight!

104
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,615
I forget.

105
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,375
Now whose Automail
belongs in a scrap heap?

106
00:08:10,499 --> 00:08:11,199
Take that!

107
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,005
510,000 cens!

108
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,506
I can hardly believe it!

109
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,545
It's perfect!

110
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,005
Now you can buy me all those new
Automail parts I've been looking at!

111
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,005
You know, it made
me really happy.

112
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:28,526
Yeah?

113
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,125
What did?

114
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,205
Never mind.

115
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,520
You guys again.

116
00:08:42,521 --> 00:08:44,996
Yeah, thanks a lot
for humiliating us.

117
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,595
Now give us back the money, unless
you want Jumbo here to get angry.

118
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,456
No way!

119
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,276
This is ours!

120
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,595
We won it fair and square!

121
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,716
Yeah, right!

122
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,355
I know for a fact that little
shrimp cheated us to win!

123
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,056
Huh?

124
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:56,375
Ha!

125
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,176
You've used alchemy to
cheat people out of their money!

126
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,795
And you used it to cheat back!

127
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,416
Alchemy, Ed?

128
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,335
Is that true?

129
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,115
Yeah.

130
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,996
Did you know about this?

131
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,475
What?

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,215
Yeah.

133
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:08,915
Oh.

134
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:12,290
Edward?

135
00:09:12,291 --> 00:09:12,945
Yeah.

136
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:17,945
Winry!

137
00:09:29,805 --> 00:09:30,605
That hurt.

138
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,465
Hey!

139
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:32,897
What do you think you're doing?

140
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:34,621
Brother!

141
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,865
You're such a jerk!

142
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,535
Colonel, I've brought
you Major Armstrong.

143
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,055
Let's keep this low-key.

144
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,995
We've investigated
around the clock.

145
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,675
We believe we know the identities
of Brigadier General Hughes' killers.

146
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,815
Then why haven't
you arrested them?

147
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,316
We're not sure
where they're hiding.

148
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,075
Though we have our suspicions.

149
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,915
I want the names.

150
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,175
I can't.

151
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:12,036
This is a direct command from
an officer who outranks you.

152
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,995
I'm sorry, sir.

153
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,076
Forget it.

154
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,175
Just leave.

155
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:17,815
Yes, sir.

156
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,505
Some help?

157
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,145
Actually, he was.

158
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,445
He specifically said the
identities of Hughes' killers.

159
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:32,145
Meaning there's more
than one responsible.

160
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,150
I ordered him to speak.

161
00:10:34,151 --> 00:10:37,338
The fact he couldn't is a clear
sign that someone who outranks

162
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,305
me must have told him to keep
his mouth shut about this case.

163
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:45,790
You combine that with what Lieutenant
Ross reported about Ed claiming to have given

164
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:48,985
up on the Stone and not wanting the
military to know where he was going.

165
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,405
I think someone high up has a dangerous
interest in the Philosopher's Stone.

166
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,485
Does that mean...

167
00:10:54,810 --> 00:10:57,239
For now, Lieutenant,
we'll stay in the dark.

168
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,305
I can't believe
Winry's not back yet.

169
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:11,165
You know, it was wrong to
use alchemy in that contest.

170
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:13,825
Well, I only did it because
those con men were cheating.

171
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:16,385
Yeah, but...

172
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,215
Did you hurt your arm?

173
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,056
I saw you there.

174
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,495
In the wrestling match.

175
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,935
Yeah...

176
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,315
Can I sit down?

177
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,995
Sure.

178
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,675
Your legs.

179
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,315
So they're Automail as well?

180
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,615
Yeah, they are.

181
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,895
How'd you know?

182
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,035
Lucky for you, I'm a Mechanic.

183
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,775
You really banged
your arm up, huh?

184
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,595
Yeah.

185
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,175
Let me see it.

186
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,135
Impressive.

187
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,135
The structure's so
simple, yet effective.

188
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,835
It's very efficient.

189
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,175
The suspension feels
a bit out of whack here.

190
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,355
And the cylinder
must have gotten bent.

191
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,815
You really know your stuff.

192
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:20,580
Whoever made this is obviously
talented and more familiar with it than I am.

193
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:23,755
You should have them take a
look at it as soon as possible.

194
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,896
You're right.

195
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,195
I know I should, but...

196
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,115
So, how did it happen?

197
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,615
What?

198
00:12:41,415 --> 00:12:42,015
Oh.

199
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,995
There was a train wreck.

200
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,045
That was the mechanic?

201
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,430
Yeah.

202
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:22,905
Dominic took me into his home and
custom made this Automail for me.

203
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,786
That's all the more reason
to get him to fix your arm.

204
00:13:26,810 --> 00:13:27,945
He cares about you.

205
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,625
I guess you got a good point.

206
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,945
I don't get it.

207
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,765
Why are you so
reluctant to ask him?

208
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,545
Because then I'll have to tell
him I lost in that big contest.

209
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,465
I can't do that.

210
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,505
The only reason I entered that stupid
thing was to prove his Automail was the best.

211
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,416
Well, I've got it.

212
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,606
All you need is some other way to show
everyone what your Automail is capable of.

213
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,225
Yeah.

214
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,045
Easier said than done.

215
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:07,125
What if you could show up a State Alchemist
who also happens to be the reigning champ now?

216
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,146
Wouldn't that prove beyond a doubt
how awesome your equipment is?

217
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:12,225
And how can I pull that one off?

218
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,425
Don't worry.

219
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,605
You have me.

220
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,015
Paninya, what are
you doing here?

221
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,680
Hello, Dominic.

222
00:14:29,681 --> 00:14:30,295
Hi.

223
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,228
It's a real pleasure
to meet you, sir.

224
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:34,016
I'm Winry Rockbell,
visiting from Risembool.

225
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,975
I'm an Automail Mechanic, too.

226
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,475
Did you say you're a
Rockbell out of Risembool?

227
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,015
Are you related to Pinako,
the leopardess of Risembool?

228
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,355
I can still hear that
bone-chilling laugh!

229
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,615
You knew my grandmother?

230
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,635
What happened to your arm?

231
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,295
Nothing.

232
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,855
Do what you want.

233
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,496
Where the hell'd she go?

234
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,395
I'm not sure we'll
ever see her again.

235
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,315
She must have spent
the night outside.

236
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:14,935
Hey!

237
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,055
Good.

238
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,055
I found you.

239
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,416
You found us?

240
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,730
We looked for you everywhere.

241
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:23,620
Sorry.

242
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:25,595
Guess I did lose
my temper yesterday.

243
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,935
Hi there, fellas.

244
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,715
You're the girl
from that contest.

245
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,680
Her name's Paninya, and she
was nice enough to let me

246
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,136
stay at
her place last night.

247
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:34,815
Really?

248
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,655
So, uh, Edward.

249
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,215
Yeah?

250
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,615
Can I see your pocket
watch for a second?

251
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:41,196
And why should I do that?

252
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,664
Please?

253
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:42,875
Okay.

254
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,295
But you can only look this time.

255
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,535
Thanks a lot!

256
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,196
What are you doing?

257
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,375
It's you against her.

258
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:59,255
If you can snap your precious watch back from her
before she makes it to the pawn shop, then you win.

259
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,215
Hehehe.

260
00:16:02,385 --> 00:16:05,215
Come and get it, little man,
if you think you can take me.

261
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,435
What the hell?

262
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,255
Winry!

263
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:10,115
Better run if you don't want
that watch to get hawked.

264
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,595
And no cheating this time.

265
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,695
Brother!

266
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,180
Winry!

267
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:20,615
Why would you do that?

268
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,735
It's simple.

269
00:16:22,145 --> 00:16:25,215
I want Ed to gain some
appreciation for good Automail.

270
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,175
Get back here!

271
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,055
Give me back my watch!

272
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:44,615
Having trouble keeping
up with me, are ya?

273
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,295
Keep on dreamin'!

274
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,135
Dammit, she's
like a freakin' cat!

275
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,915
You know, when you can't win using
your legs, there's always alchemy!

276
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,335
Screw you!

277
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,195
Whoops.

278
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,195
All right, I played
your stupid game.

279
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,775
Now give me my watch!

280
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,220
Nah.

281
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:17,315
I got somethin' else for ya.

282
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,455
Maybe she went
a little overboard.

283
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,015
What?

284
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:26,975
I sure hope I
didn't... kill him.

285
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,385
Let's see... where am I?

286
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,305
Damn you!

287
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:57,865
You okay?

288
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:00,725
I'd feel better if I won.

289
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,965
I've got no idea what you
were tryin' to prove by that.

290
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,865
But you weren't gonna beat me.

291
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:08,305
I've got the best
Automail in the world!

292
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,422
I wanted to show how incredible Dominic's
Automail is so he can get the respect he deserves.

293
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,815
It looks pretty
incredible to me.

294
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:28,635
You misguided child.

295
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,715
Hello, sir.

296
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,656
You don't have to prove
anything to anyone.

297
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,432
You understand?

298
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,815
Yeah, but...

299
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:35,755
Take note.

300
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,011
Automail is more than
nuts and bolts and machinery.

301
00:18:39,335 --> 00:18:41,295
It's your arm and your legs.

302
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,875
It doesn't matter what
anyone else thinks about it.

303
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:49,055
I honestly thought I raised you to
know that fact for yourself, Paninya.

304
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,415
I get it.

305
00:18:53,480 --> 00:19:01,455
You build Automail as an extension of the person's
soul, and in time, it becomes a part of who they are.

306
00:19:04,945 --> 00:19:05,776
It's really true.

307
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,995
When I could finally stand up again, I felt
complete for the first time in a long while.

308
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:24,505
I'm begging you,
Colonel, please.

309
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:29,425
You have to find the monster that did this to
Lieutenant Cur-I mean Brigadier General Hughes.

310
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,285
I'll do anything I can to help.

311
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:36,191
The military's investigation into the death of
Maes Hughes has been officially suspended.

312
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,085
But that's why you should
use your power to reopen it!

313
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:44,045
I see that you're working as
tirelessly as always, Colonel Mustang.

314
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,725
It's good to see
you, General Hakuro.

315
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,125
If the rumors are true, we'll be
seeing a lot more of each other.

316
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:53,865
Of course, rumors alone
won't get you back into Central.

317
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,570
If you support my transfer, General, I
pledge to serve you with all my heart

318
00:19:58,571 --> 00:20:01,325
and soul, and I'd be honored
to work under your leadership.

319
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:04,465
I must say I'm liking
your attitude, Mustang.

320
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:11,225
Excuse me!

321
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,435
I'm on my way to the top.

322
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,995
You coming with me?

323
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,695
You know the answer to that.

324
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,035
Well, it was nice meeting you.

325
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,435
Say hi to Winry for me!

326
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,695
Hey, Ed.

327
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,935
You asleep yet?

328
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,715
No.

329
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:52,436
You know, I think you may have grown
an inch or two since the last time I saw you.

330
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,495
People do that.

331
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:57,095
At this rate, you'll probably
outgrow your arm and leg soon.

332
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,735
Want to go back to Risembool
so I can make new ones?

333
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,975
Let me think about it.

334
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,755
Nah, I think I'll pass for now.

335
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,555
But why?

336
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:19,045
Haven't you been satisfied
with my Automail, Ed?

337
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:22,985
I promise to make
the next even better.

338
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:28,685
I've been studying hard, so it'll be just as
top of the line as any of the big city dealers.

339
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:30,425
So...

340
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,485
What do you say?

341
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,665
Oh, Winry.

342
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,326
Your Automail's the best.

343
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:38,985
Really.

344
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:43,185
It's just that we're still trying to
get our bodies back to normal.

345
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:44,965
We have to.

346
00:21:54,010 --> 00:21:54,705
Brother!

347
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,440
You're not gonna
believe who's here!

348
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:39,555
Full Metal Alchemist

349
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:41,979
Episode 27, Teacher.

350
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:46,776
I'm sorry, Teacher.

351
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,435
She was our mother.

352
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,895
What could we do?
