1
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,220
Hey, find anything good yet?

2
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,980
No, nothing but garbage.

3
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,600
Well, keep trying, man.

4
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,008
We all gotta pull
our weight, huh?

5
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,590
Thank you for such
a warm welcome.

6
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,770
But you're sure? You realize
who we are and where we're from?

7
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,190
Judging by your complexion and
eye color, I'm guessing Ishbalan, right?

8
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:00,630
Well, don't worry.

9
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,770
This is a place of refuge for those who have been
banished from their homeland for whatever reasons.

10
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:07,450
No questions asked.

11
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,990
We accept criminals and
Military deserters alike.

12
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,350
An eclectic mix.

13
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,330
Here, you must be thirsty.

14
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,730
I found the man from Ishbal
with the scar on his face!

15
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:24,330
It's the opportunity you've
been waiting for, Yoki!

16
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:25,630
Hey, kid!

17
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:26,770
Wait up!

18
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,450
Hey, hold on a sec!

19
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:31,210
Listen, I'm sorry!

20
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,476
I didn't mean to attack
you like that back there!

21
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:42,452
He just slipped through a
solid brick wall, but how?

22
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,740
You're a real pain!

23
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,680
If you can't tell, I'm
a little busy right now.

24
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:57,900
They say you're a genuine State Alchemist who's
looking to get his hands on the Philosopher's Stone.

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:01:59,660
Is that correct?

26
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:06,800
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

27
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:10,780
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

28
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,200
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

29
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,420
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

30
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,870
Half a pound of ham, 128 Cens.

31
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,430
I need to speak with Izumi.

32
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,898
Can you tell me
where to find her?

33
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,530
Chicken breast, 160 Cens.

34
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,887
All right, maybe you can tell me if the Elric
brothers, Edward or Alphonse, have been here.

35
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,930
Any clue who this Joker is?
- Cubed Steak

36
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,050
- 215 cens a pound. Or what
he might want with Ed and Al?

37
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,950
Not the small guy.

38
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:18,730
The big guy's usually friendly,
but he doesn't look happy now.

39
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,210
- Smoked Sausage 27 cens per link. And I'm
guessing if he's looking for the boys, it can't be too good.

40
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,590
Top-grade boneless
Chuck roast, 200 per pound.

41
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,990
We're here on official
Military business.

42
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,330
You have no need
to protect them.

43
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,930
Ground beef, pork or
Turkey, 98 cens a pound.

44
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,611
I'll take care of this one, sir.

45
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,300
Stop, Major!

46
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,560
Ed and Al are... What the...?

47
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,656
Guess they've earned
each other's respect.

48
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
The muscles did
the talking for them.

49
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,200
That's just odd.

50
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,780
What's that you were saying,
miss, about Edward and Alphonse?

51
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,970
I don't know what you mean.

52
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,410
Oh, I think you do.

53
00:05:58,411 --> 00:06:03,310
Rumor has it you used your brother's body
as a sacrifice and had to transmute his soul.

54
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,570
Though why you used his and
not your own, they don't say.

55
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:11,050
Ungrateful bastard, I'm
trying to take you to safety.

56
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,970
And that means you and
that freak you call a brother.

57
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,370
Who are you calling a freak?

58
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,430
It's true you really are
as hollow as a tin can.

59
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:26,890
Tucker was right.

60
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:27,670
Tucker?

61
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,230
Now you're dead.

62
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:29,950
Don't get upset.

63
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,230
It's not like it hurt
when I decapitated you.

64
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,477
It won't get away that easy.

65
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,910
Your powers are uncanny.

66
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,370
Then again...

67
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:45,330
I'm uncanny, too.

68
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,390
What the hell was that thing?

69
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,900
A chimera.

70
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:54,880
Interesting.

71
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,680
It must have escaped from Laboratory
Five during all the commotion.

72
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,660
The Major!

73
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
We haven't seen you in a while.

74
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,020
Yes.

75
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,940
This man here is Lieutenant
Colonel Frank Archer.

76
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,540
He's the ranking officer in
charge of the Military Court.

77
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,060
Then what are you
doing this far south?

78
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,480
The Military Court?

79
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,680
You must work pretty closely with
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, then.

80
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,580
How's he doing?

81
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:22,180
We'd like to ask you some questions regarding
that chimera and a few more unexplained events.

82
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,400
I'd love to stick around and chat,
but we don't have time right now.

83
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,200
Let's go, Al.

84
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,280
Right behind you.

85
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,620
This is certainly
getting interesting.

86
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,560
A perfectly functioning chimera.

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,100
It will be mine.

88
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,220
What happened?

89
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,860
What happened?

90
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,120
We just saved your dumb ass!

91
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,300
How come my arms and legs
look so different from both of yours?

92
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,300
That's because this arm
and one of my legs aren't real.

93
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,280
That's dumb.

94
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,120
What'd you do with the real
ones you were born with?

95
00:08:27,121 --> 00:08:29,420
It's hard... to explain.

96
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,840
Well, where are they now?

97
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,280
What about you?

98
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,880
Are you sure you don't
remember how you got this scar?

99
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:41,980
No.

100
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,560
You know, it could
just be a coincidence.

101
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,140
I don't think so, Al.

102
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,280
But your arm and leg were both
taken in the equivalent exchange, right?

103
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,680
So what would they
be doing back here?

104
00:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,080
You have to admit,
that's a little weird.

105
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,640
Oh yeah, it's more
than just a little weird.

106
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,726
But as long as we're
stretching the limits of possibility,

107
00:09:04,727 --> 00:09:07,540
let's just say he was able to
salvage my limbs from the gate.

108
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,300
And possibly, we
could get your body, too.

109
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
Here, take a look at the
bottom of the kid's right foot.

110
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,090
He may be the key to
the mystery of Lab Five.

111
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,390
I want him detained.

112
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,190
But what should we do
about the Elric brothers?

113
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:31,490
Forget them.

114
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,290
Now we've found a
much more valuable target.

115
00:09:33,291 --> 00:09:34,110
Your move.

116
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,270
Hey, is everything okay?

117
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,870
Or did I do something wrong?

118
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:41,970
Brother!

119
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,976
Major, what the
hell are you doing?

120
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,470
Brother, no!

121
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,410
What do you want to do with him?

122
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,366
He's an innocent kid!

123
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,650
He's totally lost his memory!

124
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,810
This kid may be a material witness to
everything that happened in Lab Five.

125
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:13,390
He's coming to South
Headquarters for questions.

126
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,130
But he doesn't
even know who he is!

127
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,810
Perhaps, but we've managed to
get a solid clue as to his identity.

128
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,410
That Mark... it's what
the homunculi had.

129
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,330
Give me a few good hours with him, and
he'll lead us to the ones who destroyed Lab Five.

130
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,220
Major!

131
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,760
Go to your teacher's
house, Edward.

132
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,920
Wait there so we can
find you when we're done.

133
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,840
I'm afraid we're going to need
to take your testimony again.

134
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:51,749
I thought this whole investigation had been
officially suspended by the Führer himself.

135
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:58,590
A long time ago, a fox
took a bite out of my arm.

136
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,870
Right here.

137
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,810
That kid has the same
wound in the same spot.

138
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:09,875
Then there's his left leg, which
doesn't look like it belongs with his body.

139
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,090
You honestly believe that
his arm and leg are yours?

140
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,450
That's preposterous, Ed.

141
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,210
I'm not sure!

142
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:18,210
That's why I need a
chance to confirm it!

143
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,170
Don't pursue this.

144
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,230
How can we stop?

145
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,870
This is the kind of break
we've been hoping for!

146
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,350
Say we do investigate.

147
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:32,870
And say we find some way to prove
that those are indeed your limbs.

148
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:33,990
Then what?

149
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,950
What would you do, Ed?

150
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:40,090
Would you tear them from his
body and sew them on yourself?

151
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,310
Of course not.

152
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,210
Then you're better off
never knowing the truth.

153
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,900
Yoki, you say?

154
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,900
I know I've heard
that name before.

155
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,020
He claims he once oversaw the Military's
mining operation at Youswell in the East.

156
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,300
Yes, I remember now.

157
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,160
Yes, I'm positive.

158
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,780
I saw him with my own two eyes.

159
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,860
Yes, yes, that's correct.

160
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,926
That's wonderful news.

161
00:12:21,275 --> 00:12:24,440
I'll be sure to let Führer Bradley
know, and if it does turn out to be true,

162
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,420
maybe he'll reinstate
you into the Military.

163
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,640
Thank you!

164
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,680
And the Military man slung him over his back and carried
him all the way to South Headquarters for questioning.

165
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:37,760
What a shame, but good
for you for finding him.

166
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,940
He sounds special.

167
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:43,780
I want you to forget about tracking the Smelric
brothers for now, and keep your eye on the little imp.

168
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,540
You got it?

169
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,100
Turns out those Elric boys are
exactly as you described them.

170
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,860
Yes, I'm sure they'll
be of great use to you.

171
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,857
When I first heard that Envy, Pride, and the rest
were after these twerps, I didn't give a damn anyway.

172
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,760
I just wanted to grab the boys
myself to piss off the others.

173
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,020
But now the boys have led us to
someone actually worth chasing.

174
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:14,100
To think there's a homunculus like
me who can honestly use alchemy.

175
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,900
We need to have him on our side,
or things may get complicated later.

176
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,020
Let me break him out, sir.

177
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,500
Have you gone insane?

178
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,295
You can't just go
charging into that place.

179
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,245
It's a bloody fortress.

180
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,300
You're a former
Military lab rat.

181
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,668
I shouldn't have
to tell you that.

182
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,040
Not that anyone asked, but I used to be
stationed at South Headquarters back in the day.

183
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,020
You're right.

184
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,980
We didn't ask, so
keep your trap shut.

185
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,480
State Alchemist.

186
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:37,860
No.

187
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:42,460
Since you've so passive-aggressively
volunteered, perhaps you can guide these two there.

188
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,248
But if I learn you've betrayed our
cause, I won't be feeling too friendly.

189
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,740
You can rest easy, boss man.

190
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,200
All I'm really wanting... is a chance
to make some fireworks again.

191
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,080
What did you boys do to him?

192
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:08,680
We didn't do anything.

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,800
Why are you making such a big
fuss over him anyway, teacher?

194
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Maybe it's the
best thing for him.

195
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,220
They might be able to
track down his identity.

196
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,740
And besides, he's not human.

197
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:26,520
You may not believe they exist.

198
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,820
We didn't.

199
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,880
But we've seen more than
our share of homunculi recently.

200
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,420
They're real, and
they're terrifying.

201
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,180
They have powers that
ordinary humans don't.

202
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:38,180
A mouth that can
chew through metal.

203
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,540
Fingers that can stretch
and Pierce anything.

204
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,800
There's even a homunculus
that can morph into anyone.

205
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,980
That child may have
special abilities, teacher.

206
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,900
But that's because
he's a monster.

207
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:59,880
Do you have the slightest idea how a
homunculus is brought into this world, Alphonse?

208
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,400
Take it easy.

209
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,140
Do you take me for a fool?

210
00:15:04,141 --> 00:15:08,860
That I'd be so blind as to not
realize exactly what this child is.

211
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:12,700
Teacher!

212
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:13,840
Izumi!

213
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,260
So she's been
sick all this time?

214
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,260
Yeah.

215
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,820
But since she always acts so
strong, sometimes we forget.

216
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,740
But what's her illness?

217
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,740
Maybe if we transport her to a
hospital in Central, they can find a cure.

218
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:50,740
Young lady, I'm afraid that
won't do her much good.

219
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,120
No offense, doctor, but I think a big
city hospital would be better equipped.

220
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:55,940
He means what?

221
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,580
She's cut, can't be cured.

222
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:06,990
All of her internal organs,
from here to here, are missing.

223
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,590
Missing?

224
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:09,130
How?

225
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,830
It looks as though somehow
they were just taken away.

226
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:16,790
Amazingly, the remaining organs have all
adapted, intertwining to pick up the anatomical slack.

227
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,870
Still, I don't know how
she survived this long.

228
00:16:19,871 --> 00:16:22,310
Brother, do you think she...

229
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:23,670
You heard what he said.

230
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,770
Like they were just taken away.

231
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,310
So, she must have tried to
do the same thing that we did.

232
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:32,830
Doctor?

233
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,660
Thank you, honey.

234
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,520
But I'm okay now.

235
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,580
I'm doing this alone.

236
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,300
I have to.

237
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,120
You wouldn't let me help last time, and I
know there's nothing I could have done.

238
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,680
But now...

239
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:58,540
Please.

240
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,020
I don't want you to see
what I'm going to have to do.

241
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,390
Mr. Sig!

242
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,000
Please tell me Miss
Izumi's not inside!

243
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,490
How come you're
just ignoring me?

244
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:33,450
I asked you a question!

245
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,550
They're all in harm's
way, Miss Izumi, Ed and Al.

246
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:39,670
Why did they do this?

247
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:42,770
I didn't know....

248
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:44,690
couldn'ta.

249
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,170
She felt guilty, as
though it were her fault.

250
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:57,970
But it was me who made the decision to
save her life at the expense of our unborn child.

251
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:06,170
Still, she apologized to me repeatedly
for not being strong enough to give birth.

252
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,290
A baby, I see.

253
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,350
Afterwards, I didn't realize the depths
of the depression she suffered from.

254
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,570
Or how heavily the loss
weighed on her heart.

255
00:18:22,145 --> 00:18:25,690
I certainly never imagined she
would resort to such drastic measures.

256
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:26,830
What do you mean?

257
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,290
The same taken by
your friends, Ed and Al.

258
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,710
Human transmutation?

259
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,250
She tried to revive the baby?

260
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,650
She went off, all by herself.

261
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,750
And wouldn't tell me what
happened when she did it.

262
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:51,850
But when she came back to
me, all of her insides were torn out.

263
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,610
She said she'd never be
able to get pregnant again.

264
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,770
And again, she told
me she was sorry.

265
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,530
Would you like to kick
this party off with a bang?

266
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:11,570
It seems I'm gonna
need a little more sulfur.

267
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,450
That'll do.

268
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,650
Oh, come on.

269
00:19:24,651 --> 00:19:25,070
What now?

270
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:28,690
Major, we have to keep moving
or else that woman could...

271
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:31,650
Major!

272
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:34,870
My, my.

273
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,650
Things sure are hopping
around this place today.

274
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:45,820
Teacher!

275
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:49,940
I have to ask you to put him down
and get out of here as fast as you can.

276
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,900
Listen.

277
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,700
Like it or not, I'm part
of the Military now.

278
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:05,820
What the hell?

279
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,260
What's the Führer doing here?

280
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:19,570
Perfect.

281
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,345
You're here too.

282
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:22,550
So sorry to intrude.

283
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,310
We just came for the kid.

284
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:29,270
Teacher.

285
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:30,890
The Military.

286
00:20:30,891 --> 00:20:32,730
And these bastards.

287
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:34,770
Damn.

288
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,390
Looks like a four-way fight.

289
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,560
Well, then I guess I make five.

290
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,480
That man who just passed,
do you know who he is?

291
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,820
Is he another Ishbalan refugee?

292
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,140
Keep your distance
from that one.

293
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,140
Didn't you see the tattoo
branded across his face?

294
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,400
The shameful Mark of a sinner.

295
00:21:08,401 --> 00:21:13,440
He betrayed God's ways, and for
that, he was exiled from Ishbal forever.

296
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:21,430
It's a camp in the south, in
Kishua, full of the disenfranchised.

297
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,210
What of it, sir?

298
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,950
We have reason to
believe Scar is hiding there.

299
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,350
Take care of it, Colonel.

300
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:29,410
Sir!

301
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,490
We're moving out.

302
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,250
To the city of
Kishua's western slum.

303
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,690
That's where Scar is hiding.

304
00:21:38,691 --> 00:21:40,570
If he surrenders, great.

305
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,950
We'll do everything we
can to keep the peace.

306
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:46,430
But if he resists, let's be
ready to take him down.

307
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:48,930
And anyone else
who gets in the way.

308
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:39,901
Fullmetal Alchemist

309
00:23:39,925 --> 00:23:42,725
Episode 31, Sin.

310
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:45,849
Those limbs, they belong to brother.

311
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
He lost them because of me.

312
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,200
We've come too far
to lose them again.
