00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,420
Kimbley!!!!!!!!!!!

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:05,360
Hello.

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:11,540
Well, what is this?

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,380
This is where you pay for
what you did to my friends.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,969
Kimbley, what are
you doing here?

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,340
That's a pretty ridiculous question,
considering I am a State Alchemist again.

7
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:23,360
You ratted us all out,
you piece of garbage.

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,520
Now you have to pay.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:25,920
Come on, Alphonse.

10
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:28,620
You're not going to
let her kill me, are you?

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,080
Marta, stop killing him
wont solve anything!

12
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,900
Let go!

13
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,140
Tell me, soldier.

14
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:39,300
Marta: You dont understand! 
Are you ready to carry out your patriotic duty?

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,065
I have to!

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,440
Hey, what are you doing to him?

17
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,580
I'm only doing
what's necessary, kid.

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,380
This soldier here knows
it's nothing personal.

19
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,280
Marta!

20
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,730
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

21
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,410
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

22
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,890
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:26,350
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

24
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,920
Just when I thought I was going to
get to finish my day off with a bang...

25
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:13,020
You had to go and ruin it.

26
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,700
Leave Marta alone,
or you'll regret it.

27
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,040
By Marta, do you
mean this reptile?

28
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,060
She's a human being!

29
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,840
That's not what I heard.

30
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,980
I heard that she's a chimera.

31
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,280
Hardly considered
a living being.

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,080
Kinda like you, kid.

33
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:36,880
Get away!

34
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,560
Get away from her!

35
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,240
I won't let you hurt her!

36
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:48,700
Alphonse...

37
00:03:57,950 --> 00:04:00,173
Thanks for giving me the
components I need, genius.

38
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,540
Get out of here!

39
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,550
You devious bastard.

40
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:34,940
Colonel?

41
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,820
Both of the Elric brothers fall
under my direct command, Kimbley.

42
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:41,363
Understood?

43
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,120
If you have a complaint against Al,
then I suggest you put it in writing.

44
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,640
I've already filled the form.

45
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:49,560
Sure Mustang, just keep
that scrap heap away from me.

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,460
You're going to the front lines?

47
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,260
I can't very well let Lior
become another Ishbal.

48
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,380
We must end this as quickly
and quietly as possible.

49
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,120
Yes, of course, sir.

50
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:04,536
You'll have to act as
Lieutenant Führer in my absence.

51
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,220
You're seriously
ready to do that, sir?

52
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,360
Do you accept?

53
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,440
Yes.

54
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,920
Lieutenant Führer!

55
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,700
Lieutenant Führer!

56
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:21,720
I finally made it!

57
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,560
This is so gr...

58
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,780
Oh, and send some flowers and nice
chocolates to my wife for me, will you?

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,660
She gets lonely when I'm gone.

60
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,340
I'm counting on you.

61
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:33,640
Sir!

62
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:39,340
It appears that another city must be
annihilated for the sake of the Philosopher's Stone.

63
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,341
If you've come all this way to find me, then you
must have some knowledge of what I'm planning.

64
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,240
Yeah.

65
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,020
There's a rumor that you're trying to do something
really stupid, like create the Philosopher's Stone.

66
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,363
You shouldn't interfere.

67
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,773
Now this is interesting.

68
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,617
There's something important that
I've been meaning to ask you, Scar.

69
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,380
Four years ago, there
was a Chimera in Central.

70
00:06:09,585 --> 00:06:10,780
Part human, part dog.

71
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,660
I returned their
souls to Ishbala.

72
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,280
You killed a little girl!

73
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,520
Out of mercy.

74
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,392
What else could you
have done for her?

75
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,620
Those are not the kind of decisions
that we're allowed to make, dammit!

76
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,940
Anything else you'd
like to say now?

77
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,860
With that kind of messed up logic, you probably
think it's okay to sacrifice Rose and her people, too!

78
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,620
And how is it that
you know about Rose?

79
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,180
Does that make me a threat?

80
00:06:57,221 --> 00:06:57,721
What is this?

81
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,540
You don't get what's going on?

82
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,540
You're not much of
an Alchemist, are you?

83
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,740
This arm does Alchemy, not me.

84
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,580
Not true!

85
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:09,638
Alchemy is understanding a composition,
breaking it down, then remaking it as something else.

86
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:15,480
You've been instinctively figuring out your enemy's
design, then adjusting that arm's Alchemy to destroy them.

87
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:18,580
But if you don't know what that
substance is, you can't break it down.

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,640
So I've been transmuting my automail
into other metals to keep you guessing.

89
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,660
Now I understand.

90
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,006
But I can't keep doing this forever,
because these other metals have some

91
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,745
different physical properties and
it's screwing up the entire design.

92
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,413
So I'm gonna have
to make this quick!

93
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,760
You idiot!

94
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:49,360
What makes you think you can
sacrifice an entire city for your cause?

95
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:52,660
You have no right to play God
with these innocent people like that!

96
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,540
Have you forgotten, Edward?

97
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,280
I can destroy
human flesh as well.

98
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,280
Great, the Homunculi.

99
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,200
Please, feel free
to call me Lust.

100
00:08:07,505 --> 00:08:08,720
And I'm Gluttony.

101
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,300
Do you understand why we've
told you our names, Metal Boy?

102
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,700
Yeah, you've told me.

103
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:17,020
Now you have to kill me, right?

104
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,450
Oh yes, that burned.

105
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:39,090
You can't get rid
of us that easily, kid.

106
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,110
We're not weaklings like Greed.

107
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,710
Relax, Ishbalan.

108
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,924
We're just trying to help you.

109
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,890
Or shall I call you Scar?

110
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:52,190
I don't need help
from the likes of you.

111
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:57,630
If you can make the Philosopher's Stone like you
claim, we're going to help you whether you like it or not.

112
00:08:57,650 --> 00:09:00,850
And Blondie here'd
best accept that too.

113
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,690
Does this locket
mean anything to you?

114
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,890
You gave it to my brother.

115
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,930
Please, I don't know
what you're talking about.

116
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,550
You know more than you think!

117
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,430
What is it, Lust?

118
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:16,931
What's wrong?

119
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,530
I hate you!

120
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,650
I hate you for hurting my Lust!

121
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,960
What exactly do you know
about that Homunculus?

122
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,340
That is none of your concern.

123
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:39,960
Wait!

124
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,240
Rose?

125
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:43,440
Lyra?

126
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,780
Come now, Scar.

127
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,620
Perhaps you should tell Edward
how you know that strange woman.

128
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:51,240
Yes, I think that's what
Rose is wanting to say.

129
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,040
You mean... you mean
she's a mute now?

130
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,500
I want you to keep this.

131
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,860
So you have something
to remember me by.

132
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,810
When I was a boy, and my home was
still blessed with peace, my beloved older

133
00:10:16,811 --> 00:10:20,910
brother was in love with a young
woman, the most beautiful I had ever seen.

134
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,450
They had plans to marry.

135
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:34,620
But as fate would have it, she fell ill with a fatal
disease, and was all too soon given to the god of Ishbal.

136
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,420
Brother, you've been
sitting there for days.

137
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,615
What do you keep looking for?

138
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,560
It's called the Grand Arcanum.

139
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,220
It's our people's ancient
method of recreation.

140
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,860
But the Grand Arcanum
is forbidden by Ishbala.

141
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,440
You know that!

142
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,540
It's just another form of alchemy
like those devils practice in Central.

143
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,360
Listen.

144
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,520
According to this, there's a way to
bring someone back from the dead.

145
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,420
Oh, I see.

146
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,280
So that's how it works.

147
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,530
Brother, open this door!

148
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,210
Talk to me!

149
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:23,930
In his attempt to bring her back, my brother
committed heresy, defying the teachings of Ishbal.

150
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:28,250
But even after he gave his
own flesh, she did not return.

151
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,770
Afterwards, he was exiled for studying
the forbidden knowledge, the great sin.

152
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:40,090
But through all of that misery,
did he succeed after all?

153
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,865
That strange woman
who calls herself lust.

154
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:46,490
All these Homunculi we've been
fighting, do you know how they're created?

155
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,190
They're born when an Alchemist
tries to pull off a human transmutation.

156
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,650
And they take on the likeness of
the person that you tried to bring back.

157
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,570
I remember Dante telling me
the same thing once, actually.

158
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,410
She said she failed a human transmutation years back,
and it made a dangerous creature I should watch out for.

159
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,270
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

160
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,370
She must have meant greed.

161
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:08,359
But their creation alone
doesn't

162
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,930
explain how they're so powerful,
or how they know so much.

163
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:16,790
Somebody must be gathering them up, and
teaching them, and making them stronger somehow.

164
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,170
Hold on, you're saying
my brother created lust?

165
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,070
Don't get any ideas, Scar.

166
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,110
She's just a monster who
looks like the woman you knew.

167
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,130
She doesn't have a soul.

168
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,040
Lust doesn't hate this
for sentimental reasons.

169
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,700
Homunculi exist as a balancing act,
filling in for the absence of the human,

170
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,420
and so confronting the
real thing makes them weak.

171
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:42,180
She's a fake.

172
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,940
Remember that.

173
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,460
Soon after my brother was banished,
we were invaded by an unseen force.

174
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,120
The state claimed
innocence, but we knew better.

175
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,500
We retaliated, and the
long, terrible war began.

176
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,440
We had no chance.

177
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,380
In my travels, I have discovered
how to create a Philosopher's Stone.

178
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,620
No, brother.

179
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,520
We can't be afraid of it.

180
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,920
With its power, I could save
Ishbal from her invaders.

181
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:11,940
Our people were desperate.

182
00:13:12,365 --> 00:13:15,080
No one objected to his
return, blasphemous or not.

183
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,760
But just before completing it,
my brother abandoned his attempt.

184
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,340
His mind apparently shattered.

185
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:27,990
Knowing what I do
now, I understand why.

186
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:30,330
I went to Kishua too, Scar.

187
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,110
I talked to the Exile.

188
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,890
He told me about the method.

189
00:13:34,030 --> 00:13:37,130
The Grand Arcanum Stone takes
an even greater human sacrifice.

190
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,290
It's true.

191
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:44,010
A major city would have to be turned to an open grave, or
an entire race of people wiped from the face of the planet.

192
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:50,450
All those souls, displaced, angry,
still crying in sorrow at their loss,

193
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,730
are pulled into the Array, and
form the Philosopher's Stone.

194
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,270
In a cruel paradox, the Philosopher's
Stone was the only way to save Ishbal.

195
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:04,150
And yet, it would take the genocide
of its entire people to create it.

196
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,830
You have to ask yourself, how does one
State Alchemist get all the fun jobs in this war?

197
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:17,150
Can't you see that
we've given up?

198
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,610
Leave us alone, please!

199
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:20,793
My wife and children
are murdered!

200
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,086
You've driven us
from our homeland!

201
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,170
Isn't that enough?

202
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,770
Don't blabber to me, old man.

203
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,010
I'm just following my orders.

204
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:30,410
To take every meaningless life of your
meaningless people with your curious red

205
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,590
eyes and your brown skin.

206
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,130
But why?

207
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,130
Why not?

208
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,310
No!!!!!!!!!

209
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,950
All you people
just need to relax.

210
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,070
You're all going to die someday.

211
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,510
It might as well be at
the hands of a specialist.

212
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,610
Why don't we go piece by piece?

213
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:54,190
First, your face.

214
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,050
Pretty.

215
00:15:00,051 --> 00:15:02,030
Now what say we lose that arm?

216
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,350
Now what should I take next?

217
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:13,050
Wow.

218
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:15,590
Those markings look
like a transmutation circle.

219
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,810
Who would have thought there'd
be a little Alchemist in Ishbal?

220
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,890
Well, too bad you don't have one of
these, darlings, or I might be scared.

221
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,220
Dead, you Colonel.

222
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,000
What?

223
00:16:04,001 --> 00:16:05,200
Brother, what did you do?

224
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,340
The souls of our people who were
in me, I've given them all to you now.

225
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,260
No!

226
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,780
Why would you do that?

227
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,772
Because their lives have power.

228
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,840
That arm is strong.

229
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,160
It heals and sustains you.

230
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:26,820
Without it, you would have died.

231
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,880
What...what about you?

232
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:33,740
Like you've said, I've
committed the unforgivable.

233
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,040
Be honest.

234
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:39,540
You were in love with
her too, weren't you?

235
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,960
Sorry.

236
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,960
You probably deserve her more.

237
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,580
But I'm going to see her first.

238
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:05,240
Your brother turned his body into a transmutation
circle to make the Philosopher's Stone inside him.

239
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:09,140
He was taking in the souls of
all the Ishbalans dying in the war.

240
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,300
And that's why your arm
can deconstruct things.

241
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,900
That's correct, because
it's part of the transmutation.

242
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,380
It's looking for ingredients,
souls, for the stone.

243
00:17:19,335 --> 00:17:22,143
And that's why it reacts with the
stone fragments Marcoh made.

244
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,640
It senses the lives
inside and sucks them in.

245
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,740
But it hasn't been enough.

246
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,280
In order to complete
it, I still need more lives.

247
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,983
You think that gives you
the right to use Rose as some

248
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,900
charismatic puppet while you
sacrifice her people for your stone?

249
00:17:34,901 --> 00:17:35,500
Calm down.

250
00:17:36,395 --> 00:17:37,940
You've misunderstood
his tactics.

251
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,960
Scar isn't going to
kill anyone from Lior.

252
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,640
Tell me, Lyra, what the hell
are you doing here anyway?

253
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,920
After Dante was murdered,
I didn't know what to do.

254
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,385
I went searching for a place where
I could do some good with Alchemy.

255
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:52,580
Here, I learned about Scar
and his plans for justice.

256
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,620
You don't have to worry, Ed.

257
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:59,370
Right before the attack, the people will escape
through a secret passage below the church.

258
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,520
When the military invades,
Scar will activate the array.

259
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,460
Soldiers have
lives just like us.

260
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,480
I don't care what you
think of the Military.

261
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:17,275
They're still...

262
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,110
You have no idea what the soldiers
have done to the people of Lior.

263
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,250
Like what?

264
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,650
What'd they do to Rose?

265
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,010
A group of them
carried her to their base.

266
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:44,530
Whatever they did to her there was traumatic
enough that she couldn't speak when she returned.

267
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:49,370
My sympathy will not
be spent on Soldiers.

268
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:51,978
Neither should yours.

269
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,230
Marta, where'd you go?

270
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,390
I'm worried about my brother.

271
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,790
I need to help him.

272
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:05,770
Havoc!

273
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:07,990
What's going on?

274
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,290
Are we going to war?

275
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,430
Sorry kid, I'm really not sure.

276
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:13,302
I've just heard that the
Führer has shown up.

277
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,030
So, the Führer himself
has come to see me.

278
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,550
I'm flattered.

279
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,390
I have an assignment
for you, Kimbley.

280
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,710
A secret one.

281
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,690
I want you to take Dr. Tucker's
chimeras and make your way into Lior.

282
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,050
Don't be spotted.

283
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,090
Oh, I get it.

284
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:44,310
I caused just enough trouble that
the rebels retaliate against the military,

285
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,450
then we can claim
they started it.

286
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:47,230
Brilliant.

287
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:50,650
But I designed these chimeras
to defend us, not attack.

288
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:53,790
Preemption is a difficult
concept for people to understand.

289
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,230
We'll be able to explain the
matter better if they attack first.

290
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:03,170
Also, I'm told a State Alchemist has
already gone into Lior and did not return.

291
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,150
Yes, Edward Elric.

292
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,810
I have no doubt those
zealots have killed him.

293
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,950
Make certain you
bring back his corpse.

294
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:10,850
Of course.

295
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,870
An even better reason for war.

296
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,450
People love a martyr.

297
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,350
Trust me, if he's not
dead yet, he will be soon.

298
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:20,170
It really is a shame.

299
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,670
So it all starts again, does it?

300
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,990
False wars, murdered soldiers.

301
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,463
Well, I won't let you do
it, and you won't kill Ed.

302
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,315
Call off your orders or else.

303
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:48,250
Your agile moves won't work
against me, Snake Chimera.

304
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,470
I have the ultimate eye.

305
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,730
The Elrics.

306
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,010
I have to tell them.

307
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,120
Al!

308
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:06,480
Marta?

309
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,420
Listen carefully.

310
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,600
I don't have much time.

311
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,860
Here, get in.

312
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,900
You've got to tell Ed.

313
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:40,530
I hope she didn't cause
you harm, Alphonse.

314
00:21:40,930 --> 00:21:45,070
But now the fugitive Chimera has been
executed, and I thank you for your help.

315
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,886
Fullmetal Alchemist

316
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,982
Episode 41,
Holy Mother.

317
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:45,150
I can hear it.

318
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,290
That voice.

319
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:49,610
It should have been lost
to the crimes of the past.

320
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:52,450
But now, it could save my life.
