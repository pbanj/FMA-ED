1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:08,070
Dante, I want you to stop using my
sons as pawns in your malicious game.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:13,750
In exchange for that promise, I will tell
you the reason your new body is rotting too.

3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,810
Perhaps, but it's been centuries
since our last meeting, Hohenheim.

4
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:25,370
We'll have plenty
of time to talk later.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,700
Right now, why don't you
help me enjoy this new body?

6
00:00:30,835 --> 00:00:32,970
Sorry, but I have a wife.

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,410
So, I was married
as well, wasn't I?

8
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:38,610
Again and again
and again and again.

9
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:43,710
After all, if I stayed with one of them, he'd have
noticed my slowly aging body and our secret would be out.

10
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,130
That's where we're different.

11
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,370
Tricia was my first and my last.

12
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:49,450
The only woman
I ever really loved.

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,690
How odd.

14
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:55,910
Four hundred years ago, when we first
met, back when I was still an innocent,

15
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,290
you whispered
words of love to me.

16
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,930
Or do my memories deceive me?

17
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:02,950
No, they don't.

18
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:09,630
On that day, four hundred years
ago, we had finally achieved our goal.

19
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:19,170
By using the lives of those sentenced to
hang during the witch hunts, and those who

20
00:01:19,271 --> 00:01:28,890
were dying of the plague, by repeating our experiments
relentlessly, despite countless failures, we finally grasped it.

21
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,010
The Philosopher's Stone.

22
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:55,030
But the demands of the
transmutation took its toll on you.

23
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:56,850
You were dying.

24
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:02,670
In sheer impulse, I attached your
soul to the body of another man.

25
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,590
And it was then that we
discovered eternal life.

26
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,870
So, by using the Philosopher's Stone...
You transplanted your souls again and again.

27
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,710
Yes, that's right.

28
00:02:22,785 --> 00:02:25,946
Why did you have us find someone to
make the stone if you already had one?

29
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:30,010
After Hohenheim of Light left
my side, I needed a new stone.

30
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,170
And I didn't know how
to make one on my own.

31
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,150
That's why.

32
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,730
Tell me, why did you leave?

33
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:38,410
Wasn't eternal life
enough for you?

34
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,270
Dante, there's no such
thing as eternal life.

35
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,490
The Philosopher's Stone.

36
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:53,870
Those who possess it, no longer bound
by the laws of equivalent exchange and

37
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:59,610
alchemy, may gain without sacrifice,
create without equal exchange.

38
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,030
We searched for it.

39
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,990
And we found it.

40
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,020
Woah, you shouldn't
put that much salt in!

41
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:51,792
You're ruining it!

42
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:52,072
Stop!

43
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,640
Huh?

44
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,020
Oh.

45
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,660
Cooking is an exact science.

46
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,280
Just like building Automail.

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,100
To do it right, you just
follow the simple calculations.

48
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,240
Then, with this oven I invented, if
you did everything right, it'll be perfect!

49
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,760
With the easy-to-use temperature setting
mechanism, the built-in automatic cooking

50
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:16,260
timer, and a window in the front to keep
an eye on whatever dish you have cooking..

51
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:18,340
..inside it! Every
chef will want one!

52
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,940
Cooking is an
art, like literature.

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,101
It's an adventure in creative self-expression that is
limited only by the boundaries of your own imagination.

54
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,540
Cooking is a science!

55
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,500
No, it isn't!

56
00:05:27,501 --> 00:05:28,000
It's an art!

57
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,230
Why don't you answer it?

58
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,283
Oh, I couldn't possibly.

59
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,070
I'm only a guest.

60
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:36,090
No, no!

61
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,350
You're like family, really!

62
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,470
Get the damn phone!

63
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,430
Okay.

64
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:51,116
Hello... I'm uh... looking
for the Elric Brothers.

65
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:56,770
Shou?

66
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,030
Yep.

67
00:05:58,031 --> 00:06:00,130
Some guy with a
really weird voice.

68
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,550
He said his name was Shou.

69
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:02,970
Shou...

70
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:06,750
Anyway, he said he wanted to meet
with you and that it was really important.

71
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,150
He said it didn't matter when you
got in, you could call him any time.

72
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,610
Alphonse, he was crying
while he talked to me.

73
00:06:14,725 --> 00:06:15,226
Shou...

74
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,290
Is it someone you know?

75
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,950
Uh, no!

76
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,730
This looks really good!

77
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,610
Ed'll be so happy!

78
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,190
Oh!

79
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,150
Brother's back!

80
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:26,750
Hey!

81
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,190
Brother!

82
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,361
How come you're covered in dirt?

83
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,590
Brother?

84
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:34,890
Oh, don't worry.

85
00:06:35,095 --> 00:06:38,593
I was just leaving false tracks to make
everyone believe we were headed North, that's all.

86
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,190
I wasn't watching where
I was going and I fell.

87
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm fine.

88
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,990
You should have told me.

89
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:45,330
I would have come with you.

90
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:46,201
Think about it, Al.

91
00:06:46,435 --> 00:06:48,470
What would we do if
the Homunculi found you?

92
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:49,170
Right.

93
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,030
Sorry.

94
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:51,170
That's okay.

95
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,330
Everything cool here?

96
00:06:52,755 --> 00:06:55,370
Al, did you tell him about
the strange call you got?

97
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:56,670
Oh, that!

98
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,250
It wasn't anybody we know.

99
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,786
Maybe it was the Military
spy on us or something.

100
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,650
That's weird.

101
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,430
I'm starving!

102
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:23,000
I was the one who nominated Edward Elric to
take the State Alchemy exam, despite his age!

103
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,300
And now look at the
shame he's bringing me!

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,540
Are we absolutely certain that this boy
is connected with the insurrection in Lior?

105
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,220
Well, according to his report, he
was in Lior a year ago, where he

106
00:07:34,221 --> 00:07:39,040
exposed the Leto priest as a fraud who was
using alchemy to control his loyal congregants.

107
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:43,360
He stated that the people there had
renounced this charlatan, but in reality,

108
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,460
the man went on to lead a revolt against our
troops, and we were forced into armed combat.

109
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,980
I heard the Military suppression was
excessively violent, and that's what started the war.

110
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,000
Are you criticizing my
operations, Mustang?

111
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,580
What the hell, Terry?

112
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
Who does he think he is?

113
00:07:56,781 --> 00:07:58,380
Please, gentlemen, calm down.

114
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,940
If you consider the impressive record
Colonel Mustang has compiled, it's clear

115
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:07,580
that he's an excellent soldier who's
been loyal and faithful to the Military.

116
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,592
However, I would be interested to know the reason
why you called off the search for the Elric brothers.

117
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:17,980
The Elrics were on their way to their
hometown in the east, but changed

118
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:20,380
direction before making
contact with our squadron.

119
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,055
Now it seems that they have
redirected and are headed straight north.

120
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,960
North.

121
00:08:25,045 --> 00:08:26,100
To Drachma.

122
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:26,960
I see.

123
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,040
So, they have connections
with that tribe of barbarians.

124
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,360
Major Armstrong's tactical unit is searching
for the brothers up north as we speak.

125
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:40,163
And now... I've heard some other interesting
information that I'd like to take up with the council.

126
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,380
Interesting information?

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,580
Perhaps you gentlemen
should excuse us for a moment.

128
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,940
Not yet.

129
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,380
You see, the information concerns
your secretary, Miss Douglas.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,180
Just what are you
implying exactly?

131
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,040
It's Miss Douglas'
day off today.

132
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,180
I hope she's all right.

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:05,100
There are serious doubts about her Military record, and
it has now been suggested that she was an accomplice.

134
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,996
In the recent murder of
Brigadier General Hughes.

135
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,125
Oh my goodness, that's
quite an accusation.

136
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,570
You were really in
love with her, huh?

137
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,560
By the way, Colonel, sir, I heard
you made a Wrather important enemy.

138
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,379
Why'd you have to go and
stick your neck out like that, sir?

139
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,880
I don't know whether the
Führer is a Homunculus or not.

140
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:17,300
But for a long time, these people who call themselves
Homunculi have sacrificed innocent human lives

141
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,701
for one reason, developing the
Philosopher's Stone.

142
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:24,501
And it's possible the entire uprising and
war in Ishbal were orchestrated by them in

143
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:27,060
order to gain the lives
needed for the Stone's creation.

144
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,900
You really think
they'd go that far?

145
00:10:29,965 --> 00:10:33,665
Tell me, why would any sane person
go after the Philosopher's Stone?

146
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,160
For wealth.

147
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,180
Glory.

148
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:37,740
Power.

149
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
To gain eternal life.

150
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,640
Despair.

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,760
We've all heard the stories of what
happens to anyone who gets near it.

152
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,480
Losing the lives of
everyone you care about.

153
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:52,640
Or your entire civilization
disappearing in a single night.

154
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,020
It should drive anyone away.

155
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
Except someone
who's already lost it all.

156
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,940
Someone pushed to the brink
by the tragedies around them.

157
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,800
Like in a war.

158
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:01,760
It is odd.

159
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,920
Since Führer Bradley took over,
our country's been at war constantly.

160
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,660
Just one campaign after another.

161
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,780
You're right.

162
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,860
I never realized that.

163
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,860
I'm a soldier.

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,980
I don't mind war.

165
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,140
But what if all the
reasons have been lies?

166
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:16,940
And the sole motive was to cause
death on a large enough scale.

167
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,440
To create both the
motivation and the ingredients

168
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,200
for a stone.

169
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:28,122
Ed! Al!

170
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,130
Are you planning
on sleeping all...

171
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,390
Sorry.

172
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:32,650
That's okay.

173
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,240
Don't look so surprised.

174
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,397
A trick like that's
pretty basic alchemy.

175
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,280
Done.

176
00:11:55,285 --> 00:11:56,700
What is that thing?

177
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,160
Don't be scared.

178
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,320
It's just me, Winry.

179
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:00,740
Al?

180
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,660
I used a few materials I
found to make Al a disguise.

181
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,200
There are no seams, either.

182
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,700
No one will know he's in
there unless they break it open.

183
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,440
So you guys are leaving again?

184
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,380
Sorry, Winry.

185
00:12:15,655 --> 00:12:16,847
There's something I need to do.

186
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,720
Wait, I know!

187
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,420
You're going off to find some
way to get Al's body back, right?

188
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,057
Why don't you just
do your research here?

189
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
You're going to avenge
Hughes, aren't you, Edward?

190
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:36,580
If I give my whole life to revenge now...
Everything Scar said... his life would be meaningless.

191
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,060
Then?

192
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,520
Still, there is something
that I have to take care of.

193
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:44,180
Something more important than
what you've been searching for?

194
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,260
Or revenge?

195
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,460
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

196
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,400
What do you want?

197
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,020
I'll braid your hair for you.

198
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,620
That's okay.

199
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,040
I'll do it myself later.

200
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:55,800
I'll do it.

201
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,480
Okay.

202
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,980
Something dangerous, isn't it?

203
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,470
Brother, where do you think Dad went?

204
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:18,890
Keep quiet back here, okay?

205
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,070
How can my soul be rotting?

206
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,590
Not even souls are invincible.

207
00:13:27,705 --> 00:13:31,310
Each time we leap to another
body, we leave a little strength behind.

208
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,410
Now our souls no longer have
the energy to maintain a body.

209
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,670
You have to face
the truth, Dante.

210
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,750
That's how we're going to die.

211
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:40,850
I won't die.

212
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,830
As long as I still
have the stone.

213
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,870
I'll transfer to another body.

214
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,030
And pretty soon that
body will rot as well.

215
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,112
And the next one
will go even quicker.

216
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,190
And then I'll transfer
to another body.

217
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,690
And what about the
Philosopher's Stone?

218
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,910
How will you keep
transferring your soul?

219
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,950
You must have already used
up the small fragment I left you.

220
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,310
I forgot you haven't
been keeping up.

221
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:07,390
Thanks to a clever Ishbalan alchemist
and a decade's worth of labor, one of your

222
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,340
sons has been turned into
a new Philosopher's Stone.

223
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,431
You tricked me.

224
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,590
So you were supporting
Scar this entire time?

225
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,470
You really don't understand.

226
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:58,855
They should've told me.

227
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,030
Our sons.

228
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,990
They should have told me what
they attempted when I came back.

229
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:05,910
No.

230
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,070
No, I think I knew.

231
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:12,270
I just... didn't
want to believe.

232
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:14,170
Trisha.

233
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,370
I love you.

234
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:20,670
I always will.

235
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,690
Why, thank you.

236
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,870
You're just too kind to me.

237
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:27,930
Hohenheim of Light.

238
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:32,450
I've been doing some research
since you've been gone.

239
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,670
Trying to learn more about the gate
that is the source of all our alchemic power.

240
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:42,110
I've discovered some
fascinating things, Hohenheim.

241
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:44,910
Would you like to know
what lies beyond the gate?

242
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,390
You can't tell me you haven't
been just a little bit curious.

243
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:54,050
Did you know a part of the
gate is actually within all of us?

244
00:15:55,070 --> 00:16:00,670
As our consciousness matures and we grow more
attached to this world, we lose our awareness of it.

245
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,857
But by using someone whose link is still
strong, like a baby, the gate can be summoned.

246
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,670
I'm going to show
you, my darling.

247
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,851
See for yourself just
what is beyond the gate.

248
00:16:30,315 --> 00:16:31,115
Trisha..

249
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,120
Our boys will be fine.

250
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,860
They're yours, after all.

251
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,600
And mine.

252
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:45,596
No!

253
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,280
Shut it! Shut it! Shut it!

254
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,508
It's all right, Wrath.

255
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,900
I promise that you're not going
to go beyond that gate anymore.

256
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:00,020
Bring me the Philosopher's
Stone now, Sloth.

257
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:00,780
Go.

258
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:01,920
Take him.

259
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,320
And her.

260
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,150
Why should we?

261
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:16,030
Just so you can be
reincarnated again?

262
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:20,190
Once I have the Philosopher's Stone
and transfer my soul to another body,

263
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:23,830
I'll finally be able to turn
all of you into human beings.

264
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:28,230
Of course, that will depend
on your performance, won't it?

265
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,800
Here we are.

266
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,320
You need to eat more, dear.

267
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:55,140
If you don't gain some weight,
my dresses won't fit very well.

268
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,700
Now search carefully.

269
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,580
We have to assume they're
in some sort of disguise.

270
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,440
There's a tall one and a dwarf.

271
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,240
The dwarf could easily be
overlooked, so take extra precautions.

272
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,272
That can't be him.

273
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,248
The guy we're looking
for is the size of an ant.

274
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:11,780
Commander!

275
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,080
We found some weird
bronze statue in the back.

276
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,600
How big is it?

277
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,220
I think it looks bigger
than a suit of armor.

278
00:18:18,221 --> 00:18:19,280
But I don't know.

279
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,280
Let's crack it
open, just in case.

280
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,020
Open it.

281
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,340
Here goes!

282
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:37,080
Hey, weren't you
tall a second ago?

283
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,480
You're the dwarf!

284
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,280
Al, let's go!

285
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,080
Okay, brother!

286
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,320
Soldiers!

287
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,000
Al, run ahead!

288
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,460
Brother, I bet with the stone's
powers we can... Just run!

289
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,140
Now!

290
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,140
Thanks, brother.

291
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,040
But I could have... Al, you
can't use alchemy anymore.

292
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,520
But why not?

293
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,196
I remember the
gate now, brother.

294
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,780
And I'm a philosopher's stone, so I've been
thinking I could probably do it without a circle.

295
00:19:19,781 --> 00:19:20,520
Just don't, Al!

296
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,800
If you use the stone's power, we
don't know what will happen to you.

297
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:27,400
We'll take our time, okay?

298
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:29,120
We'll study more.

299
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,280
And do it right.

300
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,720
Don't worry.

301
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,860
It'll be fine.

302
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,560
Brother, where are you going?

303
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,260
Good old dad told us, didn't he?

304
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,220
Someone out there has been
manipulating all the Homunculi.

305
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,260
There's something here I'm gonna
need, if we're going to stop them.

306
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,480
I'll come with you.

307
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,880
It won't take long.

308
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,520
Why don't you just stay here?

309
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,560
But...

310
00:19:49,885 --> 00:19:50,580
Don't worry.

311
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,280
You just rest for a while.

312
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,700
They've officially ordered us to regroup
and conduct an offensive in the north.

313
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,940
It's a very dangerous region.

314
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:15,800
Right.

315
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:19,400
After my little performance at the
council, whoever's pulling the strings in.

316
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,056
all this must have
realized I'm a threat.

317
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,700
And before I could cause any more
trouble, they send us straight to the front line.

318
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,240
If they wanted to silence us so badly,
couldn't they have just done it here in Central?

319
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,520
Not after Hughes they couldn't.

320
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,320
It would be way too suspicious
if they tried that again.

321
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,540
Out on the battlefield, they can
have us killed whenever they want to.

322
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,740
There's nothing like the chaos
of war to mask an assassination.

323
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,860
Even now I'm having
trouble believing it's true.

324
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,400
The Führer is a...

325
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:52,783
No matter how many times I read the material Sheska
gave to me, I just couldn't put the whole thing together.

326
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,480
I needed to confront
the Führer to test him.

327
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,160
And he's responded
in classic form.

328
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,580
Innocent men don't
cover their tracks.

329
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,060
I didn't think you'd come up
here again, after all that happened.

330
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,800
I could say the same to you.

331
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,620
But I came to look around, and
try to understand some things.

332
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,040
Did you find anything?

333
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,680
I'll tell you later.

334
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,360
Why did you come?

335
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,000
Because I have a
question I need to ask you.

336
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,580
A question about what, Edward?

337
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,500
There's something I need,
and you're not gonna like it.

338
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:29,960
I'll just say it.

339
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:34,440
Edward, did you happen to keep any
of the remains of your baby's corpse?

340
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,580
You're going after them?

341
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,160
Yes.

342
00:21:44,337 --> 00:21:45,017
Hello.

343
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,040
It's me.

344
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,496
Thank you for coming Alphonse.

345
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,620
We're happy to see you again.

346
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,800
Teach me.

347
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,200
Teach me how to use
the Philosopher's Stone.

348
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,751
