1
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:14,006
What's wrong?

2
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,166
Something on your mind?

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,970
Your reactions are
slow and clumsy.

4
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:21,890
It seems that an artificially created soul
doesn't quite measure up to the real thing.

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,610
It must be such a shock to find
out who and what you really are.

6
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,530
No.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:28,990
You're lying.

8
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,530
I'm... I'm... I'm
Alphonse Elric!

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,416
Like I said, you can't
prove that, can you?

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,556
Just accept it.

11
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,740
You'll feel better.

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,716
If that's the truth,
then what about you?

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,880
What about you?

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,460
You have memories
from when you were alive.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,080
And that means...

16
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,690
How exquisite.

17
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,230
The fools keep
coming, one by one.

18
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,970
What about me, you ask?

19
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:13,650
It's true.

20
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:14,890
It's really quite simple.

21
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,503
I love to tear the flesh of
the living to kill for the simple,

22
00:01:18,504 --> 00:01:21,570
intoxicating pleasure of feeling
blood between my fingers.

23
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,710
I kill, therefore I am!

24
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,350
Whether I'm real or
human doesn't matter!

25
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:32,810
I'm a killer and that's
all I need to know!

26
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:37,866
You're right.

27
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,270
There is no need for you to prove
you exist, because very soon, you won't.

28
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,490
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

29
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,170
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:54,650
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

31
00:01:55,690 --> 00:02:01,110
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

32
00:03:42,035 --> 00:03:43,235
Ah, you.

33
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,476
You know this guy?

34
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,216
No fair!

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,720
You didn't say anything about
having other allies around!

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,140
Allies?

37
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,680
Gotcha!

38
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,181
What the... how did you...

39
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,020
So, you're in that
pitiful body as well.

40
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,500
May God show you mercy
when I send you to him.

41
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,320
Why is that symbol
there on your arm?

42
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,200
Then you've seen it before?

43
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:16,800
You don't have any
idea what that is, do you?

44
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,660
Tell me!

45
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,760
If you know what
this is, tell me now!

46
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:26,020
I see.

47
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,900
You're just dying to
know the truth, aren't you?

48
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:32,020
Well, now... hmm, let's see.

49
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,820
Um... well...

50
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,020
I'm not going to tell you.

51
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:07,895
[Laughing]

52
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,260
About 130 years, I'd say.

53
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,800
Let me break this
down nice and simple.

54
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:41,216
You can either remain in here as lab rats, or you
can come with me to bring hell to those above us.

55
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,380
Your choice.

56
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,260
I'm only asking once!

57
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,900
This building is loaded with explosives
so I can bury everything anytime I want!

58
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,480
And now, I must
bid you both farewell.

59
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,000
No, wait!

60
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,481
If you want to know about those markings on
your arm, you'll have to come in here and find me!

61
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,260
He got away.

62
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,600
Get up.

63
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,820
Oh, sorry!

64
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,940
Where are you going?

65
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,740
If you're here, Fullmetal must
be somewhere inside as well.

66
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,096
No!

67
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,116
Stop!

68
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,280
Wait for me!

69
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,640
That felt just like
an earthquake.

70
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,576
What was it?

71
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,820
Good question.

72
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:58,881
It might have been one of the many bombs set
throughout this building to destroy the evidence.

73
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,200
With that aftershock, there's
a chance even more will go off.

74
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,440
I still don't know anything
about this stupid place.

75
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,460
I promised I would help you.

76
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,280
You came here to find the
secrets of the Philosopher's Stone.

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,621
I don't know very much about it, but I can
lead you to the entrance of where they keep it.

78
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
Fine, but what about
your little brother?

79
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,360
I mean, we can't
exactly leave him like this.

80
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,736
No need to worry about me.

81
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,240
Just finish me off.

82
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,480
Get it over with.

83
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,660
I already told you I'm
not killing anybody, period!

84
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,760
You're the one who
said we're human, right?

85
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:43,700
Well, in that case,
please tell me...

86
00:07:43,701 --> 00:07:47,640
How am I supposed to go on
living as scattered scraps of metal?

87
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,460
Well, um... Don't
connect us, please!

88
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,980
Do you really want us to remain here,
guarding this abandoned building alone?

89
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,800
In this empty, lifeless
shell of a body?

90
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,560
But who says you
have to keep doing that?

91
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,200
You think we can go outside?

92
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,156
Do you actually believe that people
would let us roam around freely?

93
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,320
Wait a minute.

94
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,940
My brother has the
same kind of body you do.

95
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,180
That's why I'm here, searching
for the Philosopher's Stone.

96
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,680
So I can return him to normal.

97
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,280
If I can just find it, I can...

98
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:27,320
If we were returned to our normal
bodies, we would just be executed.

99
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,040
Now do you understand?

100
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:34,100
Even if we did become human, it
would only be long enough to be killed.

101
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,980
Or do you think they would let us,
a couple of serial killers, go free?

102
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,736
No, there has to
be... Listen to us.

103
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,736
I'm sure it seems very noble, but you
don't understand how cruel it really is.

104
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,796
Teasing us.

105
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,140
Calling us human when we
can only live in this twisted form.

106
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,380
Making us remember
what we've lost.

107
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,180
That is truly inhumane.

108
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,156
No!

109
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,176
Stop, you idiot!

110
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,500
What are you trying to do?

111
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,120
Just shut up and watch.

112
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,700
What are you talking about?

113
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,380
He's your little brother!

114
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,620
He was happy you
called him human.

115
00:09:08,621 --> 00:09:11,960
Now he can no longer go
back to being number 48.

116
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
This is the only thing he can
do to keep his human dignity.

117
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,516
No, that's not true!

118
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,980
I can't let you do this!

119
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,760
Brother, I'm going on ahead.

120
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,140
All right.

121
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,960
No!

122
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:41,210
My brother, once I fulfill my
promise, I will come to join you.

123
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,930
What were you thinking?

124
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:47,110
What were the
two of you thinking?

125
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:51,230
It was the only
choice he could make.

126
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,590
I treated you as humans.

127
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:57,230
I gave him a choice
and he still chose to die.

128
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:00,930
What could I have possibly
done different to keep him alive?

129
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,550
That is one of the many questions
in this world that has no answer.

130
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,850
I'm going to return
Al back to normal.

131
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,910
I won't let him go
through all of this.

132
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:19,270
Let's go.

133
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,750
Are we really going
to release these guys?

134
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,026
Those were the orders.

135
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,470
They're supposed to be
used for military research.

136
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:40,286
They were
sentenced here for life.

137
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:44,551
Though if you ask me, they should be
put in front of a firing squad for their crimes.

138
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:47,110
What the hell was that?

139
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:51,230
That was the sound of a building
collapsing from some sort of explosion.

140
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:54,210
What a soothing sound.

141
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,590
That's enough, Kimblee.

142
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:00,806
It really takes me back.

143
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:03,810
Back to the time of the
Ishbal extermination.

144
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,090
Get out.

145
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:06,250
You've been summoned.

146
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,446
This is Kimblee, the
military's madman bomber.

147
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,970
He killed the enemy
and a handful of our own.

148
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,670
Such a pleasing ring in my ear.

149
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,410
Makes me feel all warm inside.

150
00:11:19,411 --> 00:11:22,270
So much for the great legend
of the Crimson Alchemist.

151
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,050
You've hit rock bottom.

152
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:31,170
Now all we need is for Envy
to gather the ingredients.

153
00:11:33,010 --> 00:11:35,330
This is the moment
I've been waiting for.

154
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:37,170
Lust!

155
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,190
What is it?

156
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,810
It's him, Lust.

157
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,086
It's him!

158
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:43,966
Him?

159
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,310
No, it can't be.

160
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,370
Not Greed.

161
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,730
We have to hurry.

162
00:11:49,731 --> 00:11:51,550
Before our plan is interrupted.

163
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,060
Just checking, but we're
past all the weird traps, right?

164
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,220
No intruder has ever
been able to get this far.

165
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,740
Yeah, you mean you and your
brother killed anyone that ever tried.

166
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:11,600
So who was it who attached your
souls to that suit of armor anyway?

167
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,016
I thought you said we
were past all the weird traps.

168
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,720
This isn't a trap.

169
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,880
Damn it!

170
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,804
[High Pitched Wistling]

171
00:12:51,505 --> 00:12:52,905
What happened?

172
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,190
The Chimera have their master.

173
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,930
The one who created them.

174
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,190
You're telling me
someone lives down here?

175
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,290
Someone? I think it could be
better described as something.

176
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,280
That's a chimera.

177
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,400
You mean this one
created all the others?

178
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,920
No.

179
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,820
Not all of them.

180
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,220
It's been a long time, Edward.

181
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,215
Tucker..

182
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,820
The Sowing Life Alchemist.

183
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,740
But how?

184
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,760
The military said
you were executed!

185
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:48,780
My brother and I were still alive in this place
even though the records say we were killed.

186
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,680
Why should it surprise you that
others were kept alive as chimeras?

187
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,780
Yeah, but that's not
what I'm talking about!

188
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,360
It's Nina!

189
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,000
Nina.

190
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,256
Your daughter is dead
because of what you did.

191
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,260
How could they
allow you to live?

192
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,160
I'm living for Nina.

193
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,180
I understand how you
must feel right now, Edward.

194
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,736
But please...

195
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,180
Let me explain.

196
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:21,160
Hey, uh, I was wondering if you could
stop hunting down my brother now.

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,136
It is the will of Ishbala.

198
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,956
He is a cursed alchemist.

199
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:28,840
And if that alone wasn't enough,
he seeks the Philosopher's Stone.

200
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,880
But why is alchemy so bad?

201
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,416
I mean, you use it.

202
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,260
Your right arm has a transmutation circle
on it, though I've never seen one like it before.

203
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,300
That is the brand I received
when I accepted my calling.

204
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
To kill all state alchemists.

205
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,260
And as for the
Philosopher's Stone...

206
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,876
He's not looking for
it to use as a weapon.

207
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,740
He wants to use it to
return me to my body.

208
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,000
You don't know the horror
of the Philosopher's Stone.

209
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,176
But we do!

210
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,920
Legend says that those who get
too close to the stone will perish, right?

211
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,840
But if we were afraid,
we'd never learn anything!

212
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,897
Now that I think about
it, I heard that Ishbal was

213
00:15:11,898 --> 00:15:14,440
destroyed because someone
got too close to the stone.

214
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:15,581
Lies!

215
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,460
Ishbal didn't perish because
of the evil of the stone!

216
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,760
It was destroyed by another!

217
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,500
Brother!

218
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:24,840
Open this door!

219
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,080
Talk to me!

220
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,700
Brother!

221
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,436
Brother, is it true?

222
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,240
Are you trying to use alchemy?

223
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,310
I failed.

224
00:15:45,690 --> 00:15:47,610
It cannot be done this way.

225
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,950
But maybe if I just had
the Philosopher's Stone...

226
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,006
No!

227
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,886
Alchemy is the practice of heretics
that distorts the world God's given us!

228
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,050
You know that!

229
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,990
But... God won't help
us now, my brother.

230
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,410
Ishbala won't bring her back.

231
00:16:19,085 --> 00:16:19,885
Brother!

232
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,650
We're doomed!

233
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:27,870
They're coming!

234
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,566
Quick, brother!

235
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:30,606
The military!

236
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,770
They're...

237
00:16:38,805 --> 00:16:40,105
Brother?

238
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,790
I can finally see
it clearly now.

239
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,750
I know what the
Philosopher's Stone actually is.

240
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,206
And I understand why our God,
Ishbala, forbids us from pursuing it.

241
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:50,346
It's so clear.

242
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,166
Please, brother!

243
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,930
The military's on its way!

244
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:57,030
The enemy is trying to destroy us by
using the power of the Devil's Arts against us!

245
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,130
Yes, it's true.

246
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,130
Ishbal shall perish.

247
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:05,070
But that is something
that has been preordained.

248
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,650
It is destiny.

249
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:13,386
In my soul, I honestly believe that if I had the
Philosopher's Stone, she'd come back to me.

250
00:17:13,410 --> 00:17:16,730
And that Ishbal and all of
his people would be set free.

251
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,390
But no.

252
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,590
To bring her back,
Ishbal must be destroyed.

253
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:24,810
You can't say that!

254
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,790
Brother!

255
00:17:42,114 --> 00:17:44,114
Brother!!!

256
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:51,570
Scar.

257
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:57,050
We've heard the Philosopher's Stone could
be made from the flesh and blood of humans.

258
00:17:57,051 --> 00:18:00,930
We came here to find the
truth, because we need to know.

259
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,091
If it really is true, then
we'll... My, my, my.

260
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:11,490
This day is just filling up with all
sorts of unpleasant interruptions.

261
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:13,250
Who are they?

262
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,850
You again.

263
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:18,150
This time you're going to tell
me why you have that face.

264
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,890
My brother's work.

265
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,410
Did he succeed in
bringing you back?

266
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,990
What are you talking about?

267
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:25,450
Can I eat them now?

268
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,206
I don't know.

269
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,470
I think the armored one
might give you indigestion.

270
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:31,270
I still want to try.

271
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,570
The homunculi.

272
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,650
Homunculi?

273
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,030
They couldn't be...

274
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,286
So the military staged your execution
and then sent you here to make chimeras.

275
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,450
Is that it?

276
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:51,390
Not just chimeras, Edward.

277
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,430
I have several research projects in the
works, none of which can ever be made public.

278
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,090
You can understand.

279
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:00,030
There's still something
you're not telling me.

280
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,186
You've changed into a chimera, but you're
not like the rest of those beasts back there.

281
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,366
You've kept all your intelligence from
when you were human, and you're stable.

282
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:07,850
Something you
couldn't do before.

283
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,770
What alchemist
has that kind of skill?

284
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,190
Dr. Marcoh?

285
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,426
Basque Grand?

286
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,830
Or is it someone else?

287
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,230
Answer me, Tucker.

288
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,010
Who the hell's
running this place?

289
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,170
Please don't look at her head.

290
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,890
She's extremely bashful.

291
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:46,455
Nina.....

292
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:51,380
She's not yet able to keep her form
when she's exposed to the open air.

293
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,580
You still can't find a way to perform a
human transmutation and bring her back.

294
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,400
So you've created a chimera
that looks like her, is that it?

295
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:07,240
I tried and failed many times, and
in the end I wound up in this form.

296
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,380
But I'm... I'm almost there.

297
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,440
Almost.

298
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,340
You mean it's possible?

299
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,850
That's the same
stuff that Marcoh had.

300
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:04,490
This is the incomplete
philosopher's stone.

301
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,050
Yes, it's incomplete, but
it's still extremely powerful.

302
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,990
You've seen it used before.

303
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:20,693
If this amount of unfinished
material could be carefully

304
00:21:20,694 --> 00:21:24,040
refined, you could make
a true philosopher's stone.

305
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,180
This is what you've
been looking for, Edward.

306
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:46,390
Many have tried, but no one
has ever succeeded before.

307
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:51,310
It's an impossible task
for any ordinary alchemist.

308
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,800
Yeah, you're right.

309
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,720
But you see...

310
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,340
I'm no ordinary alchemist.

311
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:39,690
Full Metal Alchemist.

312
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,180
Episode 22, Created Human.

313
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,160
Homunculi.

314
00:23:45,161 --> 00:23:47,680
False humans created
through alchemy.

315
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:50,940
But they're only a
legend, aren't they?
