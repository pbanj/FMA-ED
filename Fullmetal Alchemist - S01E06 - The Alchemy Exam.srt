1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:08,250
So, boys, you're really
convinced you're ready for this?

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:09,110
That's right.

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:11,450
Just tell me what to
wear to graduation.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:12,430
Hmm.

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,530
Careful, Ed.

6
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:16,110
I'd hate for you to get cocky.

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,750
As you know, you
find your own training.

8
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,070
I suggest him.

9
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,210
Sewing life alchemist, huh?

10
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,344
Shau Tucker.

11
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:27,550
Practically wrote the book
on bringing things to life.

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:30,990
That's how it started.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,401
We spent the months before the
exam living at the Tucker estate.

14
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,590
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,290
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

16
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,710
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

17
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:55,190
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

18
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,890
Two years ago, Mr. Tucker used alchemy to create
a chimera that could actually speak our language.

19
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,390
Quite a feat.

20
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,370
How the heck did he do that?

21
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:54,910
Beats me.

22
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:58,510
I guess it was some kind of composite
using several animals with different genes.

23
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,510
Had the brass in an uproar.

24
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,690
Needless to say,
he's passed the exam.

25
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,350
Sounds awesome.

26
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:04,890
Yeah.

27
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,770
Now, it's not just
the two of you.

28
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,550
Mr. Tucker has a
four-year-old, so be polite.

29
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,950
What about his wife?

30
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:12,910
Isn't he married?

31
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,110
Let's go in.

32
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,230
That's his house?

33
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,430
It's so... Yeah.

34
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,330
It's pretty big.

35
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,950
Come on, boys.

36
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:26,010
The door's over here.

37
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:26,730
Right.

38
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,390
Sorry.

39
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:27,830
Coming.

40
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,230
Ah!

41
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,280
Guess everything's big here.

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,734
Oh, yeah.

43
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,200
You know that's bad, Alexander.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,780
Oh, my.

45
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,880
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,440
No, Prob.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,020
Just don't... say roll over.

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,500
Sorry about the mess.

49
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,560
We just lack a
woman's touch here.

50
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,560
Oh, that was sexist, wasn't it?

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,460
I've been so out
of sorts lately.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,500
Oh!

53
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,940
Hey Daddy, bigger
brothers clothes are funny.

54
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,300
They're like a button pin.

55
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,980
Aren't they heavy?

56
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,680
That's okay.

57
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,900
Bigger Brother is very strong.

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,840
Oh.

59
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:13,060
Uh... Er...

60
00:04:13,061 --> 00:04:18,660
Mr. Tucker, I'm sure you'll have a chance to
talk to these boys about their unusual traits.

61
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,700
Until then, please, just
take them as they are.

62
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,220
Nina, why don't you play
in the courtyard for a while.

63
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,560
Aww...

64
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,040
I bet Alexandra's lonely.

65
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,662
We'll play later, okay.

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,650
Sometimes I wonder if I
have the vigor to raise her right.

67
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:45,950
You're so young to
be taking the exam.

68
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,950
I'm happy to help.

69
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,990
And we thank you
for it, Mr. Tucker.

70
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,750
To start, we'd love to see
that chimera you created.

71
00:04:51,950 --> 00:04:52,650
The talking one!

72
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,010
I'm sorry you've come too late.

73
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,890
It died shortly
after it was made.

74
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:02,890
Besides, studying for
the exam comes first.

75
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,090
It's a monster.

76
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,950
You'll need much more than an
overnight cram session to pass.

77
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,210
Wow!

78
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,450
This is the reference room.

79
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,630
You're welcome to it.

80
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,370
I've never seen so many books.

81
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,970
And they're all about alchemy?

82
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,070
This collection
is nothing, really.

83
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:24,670
You should see the alchemy floor they
have in the National Library in Central.

84
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:27,210
Books are the
best tools we have.

85
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:31,810
Pass your exam and you'll have access to
dozens, no, hundreds of times more knowledge.

86
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,330
Really?

87
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,310
Brother, we should get started.

88
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,010
He already has.

89
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,659
Edward, making
progress in your studies?

90
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,820
Yes, sir.

91
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,280
Some.

92
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,780
But I've got to speed up.

93
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,920
There's so much I don't know.

94
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,500
Yes, the more steps we take forward,
the longer we see the path is ahead.

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,780
But you're so young.

96
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,480
You needn't worry about
taking the exam this year.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,180
No.

98
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,800
I don't care what the odds are.

99
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,900
I don't care how
long the path is.

100
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,340
I'm going to take this test.

101
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,320
I don't make excuses.

102
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,800
Waah!

103
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,120
Big brother isn't
eating his dinner.

104
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,091
That won't do.

105
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,200
You have to eat to get grown up.

106
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,920
I think I'm plenty...

107
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,060
Thanks.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,760
Wow, it sure looks delicious.

109
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Make sure you chew.

110
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:29,760
Mmm.

111
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,320
Yeah.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,020
It sure tastes great.

113
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,260
Good.

114
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,600
Now eat the steak.

115
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,580
You still up?

116
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,640
My head is too full with
all the stuff I learned.

117
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,860
Yeah.

118
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:45,940
Ed?

119
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:46,880
Hmm?

120
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,140
Get some sleep.

121
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,180
You shouldn't worry.

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,980
You're smart and determined.

123
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:53,320
You'll pass.

124
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,040
Maybe.

125
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,560
It's nice here though, isn't it?

126
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,360
Kind of like before.

127
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,900
In those days, the two of us wanted
nothing more than to become state alchemists.

128
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:10,100
We felt like once we did, this
great big door would just open up.

129
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,470
Oh no.

130
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:17,760
Is it that late already?

131
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,210
Yo, Alphonse.

132
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,410
Where are you?

133
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,430
Let's hope the dog didn't
think he was a hydrant.

134
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,408
Al!

135
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,010
Hey, brother.

136
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,732
We made angels
brother, come look.

137
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:54,916
I wish you could stay.

138
00:07:55,050 --> 00:08:00,050
I mean, after you pass the
test, it gets lonely with just Dad.

139
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,670
Huh?

140
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:07,930
What are you drawing,
little big brother?

141
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,750
A transmutation circle.

142
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,230
See if I have a wish,
it helps it come true.

143
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:13,370
Okay.

144
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:15,310
Now watch this.

145
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:24,090
You made me magic flowers!

146
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:27,570
Decent work.

147
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,010
Major Hughes.

148
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:31,290
Hey.

149
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,070
I came for you, Ed.

150
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:35,430
Gotta keep you from studying
through your birthday, you know.

151
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,230
He's right.

152
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:36,950
That's today.

153
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,710
How did you know that?

154
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,090
I haven't told anyone yet.

155
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,510
I'm in the investigations
department.

156
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,470
Wouldn't make much of a
major if I couldn't manage that.

157
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,050
Don't look sad.

158
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:48,937
You're all coming.

159
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:53,130
I can't throw a birthday dinner
and not invite his friends, right?

160
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:56,670
Welcome, kids.

161
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,630
I've heard lots about you.

162
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,730
This is my lovely wife, Gracie.

163
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,690
Your stomach's a melon!

164
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:02,830
Yes, yes.

165
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,490
You're having a baby?

166
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:05,150
Soon?

167
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:06,070
Any day.

168
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,570
There's a big fuss inside my belly saying
she wants to come out and see the world.

169
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:11,090
Really?

170
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:12,510
Wanna feel?

171
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,010
Eww, no.

172
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,950
I do, Mrs. Hughes.

173
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,330
Well, go ahead, Nina.

174
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,490
I felt it.

175
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:21,884
It moved.

176
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:25,104
It felt funny.

177
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:38,440
Who wants refills
on their birthday tea?

178
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,100
Sounds wonderful.

179
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:43,840
Gracia!

180
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,940
Honey, it's here.

181
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,820
The tea?

182
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:47,880
The baby!

183
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:48,600
The baby!

184
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,240
But the doctor said next week.

185
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,280
Well, the baby just said now.

186
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:56,040
And I'm pretty sure
she gets to choose.

187
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:56,640
Okay.

188
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,920
I'll get your bags.

189
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,360
But the snow.

190
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,860
It's a blizzard outside.

191
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,120
Right.

192
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:02,960
You can't leave.

193
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
I'll bring the doctor here.

194
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,140
You kids help her.

195
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,420
How do we do that?

196
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:10,633
I guess this counts
as party games.

197
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,240
Okay.

198
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
I've got the hot water bowl.

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,700
Thanks, Edward.

200
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,640
Set it on the floor next to me.

201
00:10:16,641 --> 00:10:17,500
Okay.

202
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,540
What else?

203
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,580
Well, let's see.

204
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,360
I guess I'll need a
lot of fresh towels.

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,900
Okay.

206
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,820
I'm just glad your
pain's passed.

207
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,787
OOOWW!

208
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,640
He's been gone for so long.

209
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:37,620
Yeah.

210
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,560
He probably had to walk.

211
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,420
I can't do this!

212
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
I'm dying!

213
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:43,588
AHHH!

214
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,380
What are we supposed to do?

215
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:46,551
She said she's gonna die!

216
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:48,427
But, that's just an expression!

217
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,475
OOOOOOWWWWWWWW!

218
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:52,021
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

219
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:56,322
But since she's not
dead, she just fell asleep!

220
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:56,890
I don't know.

221
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,580
If you think of it like alchemy,
making a life's expensive.

222
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,360
You don't have to
give something up.

223
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,780
Childbirth is not
alchemy, you dope!

224
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:06,740
Look!

225
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,300
She's alive!

226
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,900
Can I do anything, Mrs. Hughes?

227
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,580
You could all stop yelling.

228
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,300
Damn it all.

229
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,160
Alchemy's the ultimate science.

230
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,340
There has to be some
way it can help her.

231
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,880
Little Big Brother,
the water's very cold.

232
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,660
Ed, what did you do?

233
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,740
I have no clue!

234
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,960
You heated the water.

235
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,920
Alchemy.

236
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,060
How did you use alchemy
without a transmutation circle?

237
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,340
I don't know.

238
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,620
I just used my head.

239
00:11:40,136 --> 00:11:42,900
AHHHH! I can feel it's head now!

240
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:49,084
You can feel it's head‽
What's that mean‽

241
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm not touching baby stuff!

242
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,780
I can't believe she's
so beautiful, Gracia!

243
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,840
It's all thanks to you kids.

244
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,160
I couldn't have done it without the
other birthday boy and his friends.

245
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,520
We didn't do anything.

246
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,680
You were right by my side.

247
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,220
This alchemy stuff really
didn't help her out at all.

248
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,120
Nothing a hot water
heater couldn't do.

249
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:38,020
Yeah.

250
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,180
Now mom's on the other hand.

251
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,180
There's your miracle.

252
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,200
Gracia did something tonight
alchemists couldn't do in a thousand years.

253
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,240
No strings attached.

254
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,703
Our mom did it too.

255
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,100
Al, you...

256
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,208
You think I was that
soft when I was born?

257
00:12:58,852 --> 00:12:59,812
And warm?

258
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:03,410
Of course you were.

259
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,078
You were still soft
when you were five.

260
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:07,890
Yeah.

261
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,401
After the birth, we dove into the
alchemy books with new determination.

262
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:25,210
We were going to pass our exams and
get our bodies back the way they were.

263
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,700
I've been thinking, brother.

264
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,960
That night at the Hughes, you
changed the water without a circle.

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,700
Most people can't do that.

266
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,840
But it was just a fluke.

267
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,740
I haven't been able
to do it since then.

268
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,000
Still, you showed
it was possible.

269
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,940
I need to learn how too.

270
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,380
Okay.

271
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,520
How about I quiz
you twice as much?

272
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:50,327
Okay.

273
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,612
E-Day, as we called it,
was fast approaching.

274
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,830
It's always the same.

275
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:02,790
Written test, then an
interview, then practical skills.

276
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,970
There's no way to know
how many people will apply.

277
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,350
But the state only accepts
one or two each year.

278
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:10,850
One or two people?

279
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:11,730
You're kidding me!

280
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,830
It's rough.

281
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,810
Uh, what kind of stuff do
they do in the interview?

282
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,970
That varies, I think.

283
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:21,970
With me, they just ask questions, but I've
heard physical exams are pretty common too.

284
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,850
Uh, let's say.

285
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,770
After that, if you pass the first two,
you move on to the hardest challenge,

286
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,870
the practical skills.

287
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,010
Half bring results of their research,
like I did, and half perform on the spot.

288
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,770
You boys have a plan, right?

289
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:39,070
Uh...

290
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:41,790
Dammit.

291
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:42,950
What am I gonna do?

292
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,130
I didn't think I'd need
a demonstration.

293
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,370
And what about a physical?

294
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,810
They could open up my armor
and find out there's nothing inside.

295
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,870
Hey, maybe you could stuff Alexander
in there and pretend you're a talking dog.

296
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,950
I don't think that's very funny.

297
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:05,470
With our anxiety piling
high, E-Day finally came.

298
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:10,310
We hoped if we could pass the written
part, Colonel Mustang would help with the rest.

299
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:23,445
We'll now commence
with the preliminary exam.

300
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,120
Good luck.

301
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,340
Begin.

302
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:39,796
Big brothers.

303
00:15:40,006 --> 00:15:40,958
How'd it go?

304
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,400
I didn't finish, and my
wrist feels like spaghetti.

305
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,580
I got through it, but
next comes the interview.

306
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,160
I never imagined that the
younger one would pass it too.

307
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:58,720
Is that a problem, sir?

308
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,280
There's gotta be a way.

309
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:10,300
No, you can't say that.

310
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,240
I've worked so hard for months.

311
00:16:12,241 --> 00:16:13,902
I'm not dropping out now.

312
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:18,880
If you want to go on without
revealing your past, you have no choice.

313
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,220
That's not good enough.

314
00:16:20,477 --> 00:16:22,337
I'm not getting split
from my brother.

315
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,040
Easy, Al.

316
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,840
You remember what
Aunt Pinaka said, right?

317
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,620
State alchemists are military, and get
thrown into service whenever war breaks out.

318
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,080
You have to do what they say, even hurt
people for some good you don't understand.

319
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,900
It means you're a dog of the
state with a leash around your neck.

320
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,220
But, Ed... One of us has
to join to get what we need.

321
00:16:42,221 --> 00:16:43,700
But we both don't have to.

322
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,660
Let me go alone, and
I promise I'll fix things.

323
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,280
Get us back the way we were.

324
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:52,089
Brother...

325
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,410
A chair with three legs.

326
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:13,930
It shouldn't keep its balance.

327
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,050
Take a seat.

328
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,450
Alchemy is the
science of balance.

329
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,190
If you have the gift,
it will not refuse you.

330
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,610
Go on, Edward.

331
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,530
State alchemists
cannot be afraid.

332
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,240
Very good.

333
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,620
Now tell me why you want to
be an alchemist for our military.

334
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,680
Because...

335
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,340
I'm waiting.

336
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,750
Because I made a promise.

337
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,470
To the only family I've got.

338
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,930
I told him I'd become an
alchemist in service to the state.

339
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:03,290
And take all the good
and bad that comes with it.

340
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:07,244
Al,

341
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,450
Do you think we decided right?

342
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,590
Chose the right path?

343
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,830
I don't know, Brother.

344
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,490
But I do know this.

345
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,250
I don't want to be
in this suit anymore.

346
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,410
I want to feel things again.

347
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,090
It's strange.

348
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,490
We've been right beside
each other all this time.

349
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:30,790
But I can't remember what your
skin feels like or how you smell.

350
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:37,650
And then, the day
of the practicals.

351
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:39,890
I'm off.

352
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:41,570
Not yet!

353
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,180
Go on, Nina.

354
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,460
I made something for you.

355
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,060
It's a circle to help your wish.

356
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,340
It's great.

357
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,020
Thanks, Nina.

358
00:19:15,942 --> 00:19:18,382
Welcome to the
practical skills exam.

359
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:21,500
We've provided you with some
nice raw materials for your alchemy.

360
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,480
You may use them to
create whatever you see fit.

361
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,120
Gee, nice guidelines.

362
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,260
What the heck am I supposed
to create to impress them?

363
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:48,950
Impressive detail.

364
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,930
But he used so much
energy, he can't even stand up.

365
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:53,530
You can't get tired?

366
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:54,990
Out of the way.

367
00:19:54,991 --> 00:19:55,570
I'm next.

368
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:00,790
What's he cooking?

369
00:20:06,573 --> 00:20:08,847
I hope that little big brother's ok.

370
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,730
Don't worry.

371
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,490
You gave him your
circle, remember?

372
00:20:17,295 --> 00:20:18,207
AWWW!

373
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,300
Nicely done.

374
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:23,880
Trees and water into a
hydrogen paper blimp.

375
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
That's not good.

376
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,340
Look out!

377
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,650
Alchemy without circles.

378
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:20,290
I think we've found
our alchemist.

379
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,490
Youngest we've had.

380
00:21:29,501 --> 00:21:30,952
Magic flowers.

381
00:21:53,761 --> 00:21:54,217
Al.

382
00:21:55,004 --> 00:21:55,273
Hmm?

383
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:58,550
Today marks a big turning
point for us, you know.

384
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,730
It's full speed ahead now.

385
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:04,670
And if dead ends come,
then we'll find another way.

386
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:11,790
Someday, I swear, I'll get
you back the way you were.

387
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,490
Uh-huh.

388
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,950
And when that day comes, your
full body will be there too.

389
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:43,030
Full Metal Alchemist Episode 7.

390
00:23:43,031 --> 00:23:44,430
Night of the Chimaera's Cry.

391
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:48,910
Nina...
