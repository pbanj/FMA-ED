1
00:00:16,265 --> 00:00:18,320
Got my girlfriend to
bake you an apple pie.

2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,890
You want it?

3
00:00:31,395 --> 00:00:31,995
Roy.

4
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,490
It's called a taboo.

5
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:34,816
Forbidden alchemy.

6
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:35,730
It's kind of fun.

7
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,656
I don't understand
much about alchemy.

8
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,410
But I'm no fool and I certainly know what
happens to anyone who commits a taboo.

9
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,596
You can relax, Maes.

10
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,930
I haven't done anything.

11
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,550
Maybe not yet, but
you were planning to.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,200
You just don't understand.

13
00:00:54,201 --> 00:00:57,050
I killed a lot of
people out there.

14
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,550
It was a war.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,350
Easy for you to say
you weren't there.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,830
No, I wasn't.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,296
And if you didn't want to kill enemies in
battle, you shouldn't have been there either.

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,390
You should have asked
for a desk job like I did.

19
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,670
Did you think if you became a state
alchemist you could fix everything?

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,890
Bring back anyone who ever
died in a controversial war?

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,930
Invent some utopian world?

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:18,810
I don't know.

23
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:24,180
Is a taboo so easy to commit that
you just need a little binge of studying

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,139
to pull it off?

25
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,190
Or do you just
want a way to die?

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,270
Because if that's the case,
there's plenty of easier means.

27
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,426
I had it in my mouth, Maes,
and I couldn't pull the trigger.

28
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:39,846
I was too afraid to end it.

29
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,740
I'd hope so.

30
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,720
It's just the kind of
cowardly human that I am.

31
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,540
Every sane person is.

32
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:50,500
But still, even my life, detestable
as it is, will have some use.

33
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,040
Huh?

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,420
Maes, I've got a plan.

35
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,000
Let's hear it, Roy.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,466
Sir, wake up.

37
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,680
There's someone here.

38
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,906
It's okay.

39
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:04,760
I'll wait.

40
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:10,400
Führer!

41
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:11,350
Sorry, sir.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,050
You seem to be conducting an
investigation on the military's higher-ups.

43
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,210
Yes, sir.

44
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,510
It's concerning Laboratory Five.

45
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,890
I've already headed
my own investigation.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,927
I've found that Brigadier General Basque Grand
may have allied with some Ishbalan remnants.

47
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,996
and conducted dangerous
research which has been destroyed.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,330
That was my conclusion.

49
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,870
Are you not satisfied with that?

50
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,870
With respect, sir, no, I'm not.

51
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:38,560
What?

52
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:40,230
Is it the Philosopher's Stone?

53
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:41,780
Yes.

54
00:02:41,781 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm now under the assumption that there was research
within the military to create the Philosopher's Stone...

55
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:49,430
and there were many illegal acts
involved in trying to make it happen.

56
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,916
This goes a lot deeper than
just Brigadier General Grand.

57
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,920
At the very least, Dr. Marcoh's former
supervisors at the lab were involved as well.

58
00:02:56,921 --> 00:03:00,230
And there's a high probability
the people on that list were, too.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,750
A Major General, a Brigadier General, a
Colonel... You're implicating all of them?

60
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,410
Yes.

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,987
And during the past year, all the people on that list
have either passed away, been killed, or are missing.

62
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,456
But all indication is
the plan hasn't stopped.

63
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,870
Lab Five was still running.

64
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,730
And just a few days ago, someone hired a band
of mercenaries to attack an Ishbalan refugee camp.

65
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,910
My sense is the people on that
list were just the puppets in this.

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,540
So you're saying a faction
still exists in the military...

67
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,650
that will commit unspeakable crimes
to create this mythical cure all, right?

68
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,330
If such a thing got out, we'd
lose all respect and credibility.

69
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,110
Our control of this state
would crumble at our feet.

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,650
I'm joking, Hughes.

71
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,050
Investigate it fully.

72
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:47,490
The military has endured great storms of
mutiny in the past, and we'll ride this one out as well.

73
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:50,510
These outlaws ran vile,
forbidden human experiments.

74
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,436
And sent killers calling
themselves Homunculi to cover up.

75
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,980
We'll extract the bad part out.

76
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:57,290
Thank you, Führer, sir.

77
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,770
Now, there's one more thing.

78
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,716
It's about Dr. Marcoh, correct?

79
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,396
Yes, sir.

80
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,950
I have some questions for him.

81
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,870
Well, Juliet?

82
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,496
He's safe and hiding.

83
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,113
I'll have him brought
to Central now.

84
00:04:09,805 --> 00:04:14,110
She's the only person who knows the exact
location of the doctor at any given moment.

85
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:18,150
It's to prevent me from leaking
information if I were tortured by the enemy.

86
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,190
Can't be too cautious.

87
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,890
Please take me to him.

88
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,670
Uh, Miss Douglas.

89
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,710
Extract the bad part out.

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,970
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

91
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,670
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

92
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,130
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

93
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,590
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

94
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,260
All right.

95
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:30,600
So, all the higher-up officers who we assume were in
Lab Five's chain of command either died or fell off the map.

96
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,300
You'll note that the criminal with
the Ouroboros tattoo isn't on that list.

97
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,980
Sounds like they're talking about
some really heavy stuff in there.

98
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,291
Well, I'm not going to listen.

99
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,923
I've gotten myself in enough
trouble already that way.

100
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:45,406
The scientists who worked
under Dr. Marcoh aren't on the list.

101
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:49,080
Maybe they were thought not to have
enough information individually to be a threat.

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,858
If we can find
them... Leave it to me.

103
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:58,220
Um, about that... The thing is, we
honestly don't care about that stuff anymore.

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,426
What do you mean you don't care?

105
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,180
Are you crazy?

106
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,260
We just don't think we should have to
deal with dangerous things anymore,

107
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,626
like the Philosopher's
Stone or Homunculi.

108
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:10,206
Yeah, we thought it would be better
to look for a different way, you know?

109
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,470
Well, boys, it would
definitely be better, but...

110
00:07:12,471 --> 00:07:15,609
If you really thought there was another
way, why did you go through all this trouble?

111
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:16,626
Who knows?

112
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:19,026
Maybe there's not, but
there's someone we should ask.

113
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,300
Our original teacher.

114
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,326
She lives south of here,
in a place called Dublith.

115
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,060
We're planning on
taking a trip there.

116
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,120
But it's just so sudden.

117
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:28,840
There!

118
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,580
On the way to Dublith!

119
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,740
What is it, Winry?

120
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,040
Only the world wide Mecca
of Automail, Rush Valley!

121
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,686
You really gotta take me there!

122
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:37,265
You gotta!

123
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,606
I've always wanted to go!

124
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,466
Come on, you guys!

125
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:39,929
Please!

126
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:41,426
Vacation on your own time, okay?

127
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,386
Well, and who would pay
for my travel expenses?

128
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:44,220
Very funny!

129
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:45,700
We can manage it.

130
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,266
It's on the way, like she said.

131
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,440
Okay, fine.

132
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,680
Hooray!

133
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:55,960
So, they're finally gonna quit throwing themselves
into dangerous situations they don't need to be in.

134
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,906
Must have learned their lesson from seeing the
trouble we had to go through as their bodyguards.

135
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:00,846
That's my bet.

136
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,578
It would be a perfect ending if
they actually meant what they said.

137
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:08,680
They told us that to protect us, so we
don't become the next victims on the list.

138
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:12,460
It's easy to forget
they're kids sometimes.

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,940
What do you mean
we're not going to Dublith?

140
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:37,456
Don't worry.

141
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,230
We'll still take
you to Rush Valley.

142
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:40,830
Well, okay then.

143
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,316
But what about your teacher?

144
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,500
Didn't you want to ask about another way to fix
yourselves besides with the Philosopher's Stone?

145
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,650
If we go for any
reason, we'll be killed.

146
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,970
Wait a sec...

147
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:50,910
Killed?

148
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,870
The brother never told her
he became a State Alchemist.

149
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,070
Even worse, if she realized from our
bodies that we tried to do human alchemy.

150
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,730
Personally, I'd like
to live a little longer.

151
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:07,410
I at least want to fall in
love before I'm through.

152
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,799
And even if those
weren't issues.

153
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,570
Honestly, I just don't think
it'd be right asking her that.

154
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,870
So, where are you going?

155
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:22,110
We've learned about a pretty sizable Ishbalan
refugee camp hidden in the mountains to the south.

156
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,870
I think Scar and the others may have
gone there after the mercenaries attacked.

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,550
You're going after Scar?

158
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:33,750
It's been said that a philosopher's stone was
created in Ishbal, but no one ever taught them alchemy.

159
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:38,930
In fact, their culture rejected it, so we
think they may have made it some other way.

160
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,670
A completely different method.

161
00:09:41,035 --> 00:09:44,590
I'm gonna beat the pulp out of him
and force him to tell me their secret.

162
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,750
Brother, about Scar...

163
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,596
He's really not that bad
of a person, you know.

164
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,730
He's murdered dozens of people,
and he's done it by using alchemy.

165
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,330
I can't forgive him for that.

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,730
Brother! Master!

167
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,575
Hi...

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,430
Why have you come here?

169
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,760
You're not an Ishbalan.

170
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,516
Who are you?

171
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,050
Where are my manners?

172
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,810
I've forgotten to
introduce myself.

173
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,270
I'm the State Alchemist who's been sent
here to annihilate this part of your race.

174
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,980
You've got a visitor!

175
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:00,880
Master!

176
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,700
I'm glad you are safe.

177
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,460
I did not know you had survived.

178
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,880
Where have you been hiding?

179
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,480
A number of our people are
in the Southern Mountains.

180
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,326
I've spent much
of my time there.

181
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:16,126
Yes, we've heard
of that encampment.

182
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,051
We're planning to head
out that way ourselves.

183
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,576
A group of us have just completed an
expedition and escaped the military's notice.

184
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,440
We were picking up our kin
who were isolated in Central.

185
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,540
On our journey, we
heard stories about you.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,066
I gather that you've been on a
hunt, finding and killing all the state

187
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:36,620
Alchemists you could
over these past three years.

188
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:40,526
State Alchemists burned our
homes, slaughtered our people.

189
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,460
I understand your anger.

190
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,040
Yeah, he's brave.

191
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,716
I think these trash
are from Ishbal, boys.

192
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,296
They must think it's safe
wandering around the canyon.

193
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,656
You're only supposed to
live in the designated camps.

194
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,796
It's dangerous out here.

195
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,270
Someone might hurt you.

196
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:09,630
But your revenge, is it not taking out your
anger on strangers who did you no harm?

197
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,710
Revenge is a beast that
begets itself and solves nothing.

198
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,070
It only leads to more pain.

199
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,390
Remember the great
words of Ishbala, my student.

200
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:24,240
Even in the darkest of
suffering, a man can sleep.

201
00:12:24,241 --> 00:12:28,170
But for the man who inflicts the
suffering, his mind cannot rest.

202
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:28,930
Ever.

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,370
That arm with the markings.

204
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,070
Is that not the right arm
of your older brother?

205
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:15,290
You honestly don't think them being
hospitalized was important information for me?

206
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,270
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,516
I thought I told you.

208
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,436
It was just some minor scrapes.

209
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,700
- He couldn't use his arm anymore. But
more importantly Roy, I've heard some things.

210
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:24,690
Sounds like your transfer to
Central may become finalized soon.

211
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:28,350
You need to hurry up and get important
here so we can have an easier time.

212
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,844
And find yourself a good wife.

213
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,750
Easy on the phone, sir.

214
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,730
Lieutenant, book us a train.

215
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,850
To Central, Colonel?

216
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,870
Something's going on here.

217
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,010
I don't think it's unreasonable.

218
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,290
Roy's worried about
those boys, too.

219
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,670
He shouldn't worry about something he doesn't
have to, or get bogged down with trivial things.

220
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,770
Besides, if it's really
coming from the inside...

221
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,862
there's a good chance
our line's been tapped.

222
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,730
Sorry, but I still have
to check on something.

223
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,090
Just be careful.

224
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,210
Daddy has a lot of work to do.

225
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,110
Bye-bye.

226
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,270
Get me all the files
on the riots in Lior.

227
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,036
The drawing of the
transmutation circle in Lab Five.

228
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,676
Where is it?

229
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,270
Coming!

230
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,210
Volumes Three and Four
on the Ishbal uprising.

231
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,776
Let's go!

232
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,276
Am I gonna get paid
overtime for this, sir?

233
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,893
I'll give you this
picture of Elicia.

234
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,030
Ishbal.

235
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,586
Lior.

236
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,330
Mugear's mine in Xenotime.

237
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,150
They've all been destroyed
when they got close to it.

238
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,050
Why?

239
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:40,450
If this faction wants to motivate people
into making the Philosopher's Stone,

240
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:45,930
why would they cause so much destruction, starting
the rumor that anyone who gets close to it will die?

241
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,650
Is it because they wanted
to destroy all the evidence?

242
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,460
No.

243
00:14:51,461 --> 00:14:52,690
That can't be.

244
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,370
It should be the opposite.

245
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,790
What if it's all opposite here?

246
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,430
Wait a minute.

247
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,810
Wasn't the original cause of the war
in Ishbal a soldier named... Douglas?

248
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,450
Why is that... familiar?

249
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,196
Excuse me, sir.

250
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,090
The Führer's
secretary is on the line.

251
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,630
Dr. Marcoh has
arrived in Central.

252
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,690
He'll be waiting
for you at the hotel.

253
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,796
Right.

254
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,936
Thanks for working so late.

255
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,092
I'll head over there now.

256
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,790
Douglas.

257
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,150
Juliet.

258
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,630
Sheska, put all those books back
exactly where you found them right now!

259
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:30,710
What?

260
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,856
As soon as you're finished,
I want you to go home.

261
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,750
And you're fired!

262
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,110
Never come here again!

263
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,490
Thanks again for
going to all this trouble.

264
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:46,350
Tell me, Miss Douglas, do you know
anything about the Ishbalan Rebellion?

265
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,030
No.

266
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,690
I've done office
work my entire career.

267
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,110
Yeah, the same goes for me.

268
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,060
I had to look some
stuff up recently.

269
00:15:53,061 --> 00:15:58,230
Did you know the Rebellion was triggered by a
soldier who was posted there to keep the peace?

270
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,610
Apparently, she shot a helpless Ishbalan
child and it became their rallying cry.

271
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,230
Weird thing is, that soldier's
name was Juliet Douglas.

272
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,930
A common name,
Lieutenant Colonel.

273
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,310
Here's where it
really gets interesting.

274
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,050
According to a little article, the soldier with that name
died two years before the Ishbalan Rebellion started.

275
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,290
That is strange.

276
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,410
One more curious thing.

277
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:26,500
Although that soldier was reportedly
killed, the name Juliet Douglas was never

278
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:28,990
removed from the
military's active duty list.

279
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:35,830
In fact, that same soldier with the identical file and
matching ID number landed a big promotion two years ago.

280
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,470
She was selected to become
Führer Bradley's next secretary.

281
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,490
Who are you, actually?

282
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:49,905
Were you an Ishbal, or did you come later, using
the military's mistake to sneak in with her records?

283
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,250
The doctor's waiting for you.

284
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,670
Is Marcoh really
behind that door?

285
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,350
I guess I'll find out.

286
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,616
A pleasure to meet you.

287
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:05,330
Or should I make that
goodbye, Lieutenant Colonel?

288
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:08,850
That's one sexy tattoo
you got there, babe.

289
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,950
Run, sir!

290
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,790
Pretty good for a man, isn't he?

291
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,320
Come, sloth.

292
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:26,550
Let's make sure he's taught.

293
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,000
Lieutenant, the enemy's moved in
very close to the Führer, and they've

294
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:37,150
infiltrated the military deep enough
to effect large-scale decisions.

295
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,770
Their goal's not to create
the stone directly...... but...

296
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,196
Never mind.

297
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,790
Let's go.

298
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,630
Sir.

299
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:47,930
Dammit!

300
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:50,150
This is taking too much time!

301
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,040
What?!

302
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,620
What do you mean he's gone?!

303
00:17:55,621 --> 00:17:58,216
He left for Central with
Lieutenant Hawkeye.

304
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,990
Is there something
the matter, sir?

305
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:02,390
Dammit, Roy, you're
acting stupid again!

306
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,870
With this information, you
could go straight to the top!

307
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,230
Lieutenant Colonel, we
should go somewhere safe.

308
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,590
Yeah, you're right.

309
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,870
It's not like I've lost
any evidence here.

310
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,990
But now there's something
I'd like to bring up with you.

311
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,790
Lieutenant Ross has a mole
right beneath her left eye.

312
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,450
Oh, is that so?

313
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,630
How careless of me.

314
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,270
Heh, that's an amazing talent.

315
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,650
I hope you'll forgive me, but I've got a
wife and kid waiting for me back home.

316
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:54,460
You're right Hughes, maybe
this is a more fitting end.

317
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,840
I'm going to become
the Führer, Maes.

318
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,860
I'll transform how this
whole country runs.

319
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,250
It's the only way I can
justify taking my next breath.

320
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:21,526
To do that, you're going to need someone
who understands you and the system,

321
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:23,420
and supports you
from the inside.

322
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,480
I'll work under you, stay close to the
higher-ups, and help push you to the top.

323
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,660
Mom, how come?

324
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,830
Why are they burying Daddy?

325
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,610
Who are those people?

326
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,596
Why are they burying him?

327
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,030
Why?

328
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,740
He's gone, baby.

329
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,250
They can't.

330
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,636
I don't like it.

331
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,310
Daddy said he had lots of work to do, and if
they bury him, he can't do it when he wakes up.

332
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,676
Elicia

333
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,110
Stop them, Mommy.

334
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,176
Daddy needs to do his work.

335
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,450
He told me.

336
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,456
Why are you burying
Daddy, Mommy?

337
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,010
Why?

338
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:55,010
Daddy, wake up!

339
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,570
We'll catch up, sir.

340
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,290
Killed in action.

341
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,550
And promoted two ranks for it.

342
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,710
Brigadier General Hughes.

343
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,176
You're the guy who was going to
work below me and push me to the top.

344
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,616
Then you get yourself killed
and pass me in the ranks.

345
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,530
I don't know what's more
absurd, you or the state.

346
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,630
Are you ready?

347
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,970
You know, years ago, I had a
theory on human transmutation.

348
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,336
After all we've seen, I was
actually trying to remember it now.

349
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,650
We Alchemists are such
hopeless, predictable things.

350
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,750
Why didn't he tell
me, Lieutenant?

351
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,650
Ed and Al in danger?

352
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:45,870
Lab Five?

353
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,490
Maybe I could have
done something to help.

354
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,370
Maybe because he
knew you'd try, sir.

355
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,430
What's that mean?

356
00:21:55,180 --> 00:22:01,090
When those two boys are in harm's way, sir,
well, sometimes your decisions aren't exactly rational.

357
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,283
Maybe Brigadier General Hughes
didn't tell you because he wanted

358
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:09,296
you to concentrate on your
own goal instead of the Elric's.

359
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:13,550
So you could make it to the
top... without any more setbacks.

360
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,880
It's going to rain today.

361
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:28,860
Yes.

362
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,196
I guess that's what they
call a mother's touch.

363
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,770
I could eat this stuff all day.

364
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:47,836
That Mr. and Mrs. Hughes and their cute little
daughter Elicia, that had to be the perfect family.

365
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,390
Yeah.

366
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,736
Come on, perfect?

367
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,716
The guy's nosy and
obsessed with his kid.

368
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,448
He's annoying.

369
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,736
You like him.

370
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,550
He came to see us all the time.

371
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,880
Yet he's always complaining
about how busy he is.

372
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,150
I'm telling you, that big
goof doesn't make any sense.

373
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,356
Why do you think he cares
so much about us, though?

374
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:03,950
Seriously.

375
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,310
Beats me.

376
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,070
Really, Ed?

377
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,462
You'd better tell him thanks
when you get back to Central.

378
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:26,445
Ed...

379
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:29,600
Did you see something, brother?

380
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,050
No.

381
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:30,395
Fullmetal Alchemist

382
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:33,180
Episode 26 Her Reason

383
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:35,904
It never
really occurred to me until now

384
00:25:36,681 --> 00:25:40,010
that all this time she could have
been thinking of me that way.
