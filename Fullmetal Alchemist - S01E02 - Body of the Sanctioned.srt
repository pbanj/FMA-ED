1
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:05,580
I see.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,940
Now I understand you, Elric.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,280
You crossed the line.

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,700
You did what is strictly forbidden.

5
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:15,300
You tried to create human life and
your bodies were taken to the other side.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:18,080
You were crazy enough
to find out for yourself.

7
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:19,240
You are the Fullmetal.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,860
The Fullmetal Alchemist!

9
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,650
Well, that does answer a riddle.

10
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:24,470
Why the military would give a pup like you
such a stern name, Fullmetal.

11
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,070
But it's literal.

12
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,250
See, Rose, alchemists forbid their own
from transforming lead into gold.

13
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,570
But there's one practice more taboo.

14
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:37,150
A technique forbidden
by man and nature itself.

15
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,270
Alchemy.

16
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:40,730
On human souls.

17
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,550
You miserable little boys.

18
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,450
Dabbling in human alchemy
without knowing its penalty.

19
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,050
You stepped on the toes of God!

20
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,450
You don't know the story.

21
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:52,580
Al.

22
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,990
But we just wanted...

23
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,100
We just wanted to see Mom's face again.

24
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,780
See her smile.

25
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,120
But you failed, didn't you?

26
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,080
Yeah.

27
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,320
I'd label that a failure, all right.

28
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,000
Al lost his whole body
and I lost an arm and a leg.

29
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:22,240
I ignored every signpost because I
was reckless and I wanted it bad enough.

30
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:27,140
Rose, this is what happens when
you try to bring back what's dead.

31
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,600
You really want to go through with that?

32
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,500
Don't let them worry you, Rose.

33
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:41,060
You forget that the great sun god Leto
has blessed me with the philosopher's stone.

34
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,960
Besides, I have far more experience than
these heretic boys did.

35
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,080
Don't be stupid.

36
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:49,800
No matter what kind of powers
you have, some things can't be done.

37
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:52,620
Oh, then why are you so
anxious to get this stone?

38
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,460
You want to beat the laws of equivalence
just as I do and bring your mommy back.

39
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,740
Wrong, holy man.

40
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,760
All we want is to get
our bodies normal again.

41
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:05,180
See, we don't lie about what's possible.

42
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,440
We didn't start a cult.

43
00:04:06,741 --> 00:04:08,189
ERRRRRRR

44
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,920
We will ask one more time.

45
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,600
Please give us the stone.

46
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,960
You are damned, state alchemist.

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,520
May the wrath of god fall upon your head.

48
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,520
Stop hiding behind that crap.

49
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,780
Get down here and I'll
show you some wrath.

50
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,640
Sinners!

51
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,950
PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW!
PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW! PEW!

52
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,639
[Snickering]

53
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:41,849
ERRR

54
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,230
Close call.

55
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:50,410
Father Cornello!

56
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,410
Huh?

57
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,930
You!

58
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:56,989
Al!

59
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,320
This way!

60
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,720
Idiots!

61
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,160
You're running into a dead end!

62
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,160
Like I always say, if you can't
find a door, make your own!

63
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,210
After them!

64
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,150
Now!

65
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,910
Father?

66
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:19,630
Is it true what they said?

67
00:05:19,790 --> 00:05:22,490
That ring you're wearing, are
your miracles just alchemy?

68
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,410
Just because you can explain a thing
doesn't mean it's not the will of god, Rose.

69
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:32,850
What matters is that I have been given
the power to do things that no one else can.

70
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,430
Let me show you.

71
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:46,999
Rose.

72
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,010
Cain!

73
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,870
Rose.

74
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,720
The sun god's rewarded
you for your faith, Rose.

75
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,560
Your true love soul has been resurrected.

76
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,820
But the work is not finished yet.

77
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,820
His body still needs a few more days.

78
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,360
I always believed it.

79
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,880
This really has been the work of god.

80
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,560
If Ed knew...

81
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:21,680
Why do they treat us like we're evil?

82
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:25,960
If we really wanted the stone at all cost,
we would have taken it by now.

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,740
People of Lior, this evening a pair of
unbelievers tried to take the life of the

84
00:06:32,741 --> 00:06:33,740
great prophet Cornello.

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,840
One short and blonde,
the other wearing armor.

86
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:40,620
Father Cornello asks you
all to stay in your homes.

87
00:06:40,621 --> 00:06:42,000
Damien, I'll tell you what I'll do.

88
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,420
They found him on Goma Street.

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,220
Please, take all necessary precautions.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,620
No question, guys.

91
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,580
They're the ones.

92
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,980
The short newcomer and his tin man.

93
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:03,840
Who are you calling a
mousy little pipsqueak?

94
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,040
Nobody said that.

95
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,880
Now back off.

96
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,280
We got more important business to settle.

97
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,740
What kind of depraved souls are you?

98
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,117
How could you go after the prophet?

99
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,780
We welcomed you here.

100
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,220
You made us believe you were good.

101
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,080
Look lady, I never asked you to believe
anything.

102
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,060
That's your priest.

103
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,260
He's a phony.

104
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,580
He's just using alchemy.

105
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
Liar!

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,400
Just now, my boyfriend spoke to me.

107
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,220
Cornello's bringing him back.

108
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,740
You mean old cain
we lost in the accident?

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,000
He was a good kid.

110
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Good for you rose.

111
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:41,160
There, you see?

112
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,540
He's not the first either.

113
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,256
There've been many others who've come
back.

114
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:44,920
She's right.

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,460
Yeah.

116
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,520
That's not a miracle.

117
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:47,400
Tell me what is.

118
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,240
Has anyone actually seen
these people close up?

119
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,100
Cause I heard they all left town
as soon as they were brought back.

120
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,000
Look!

121
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,980
Another one!

122
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,880
A sun god statue!

123
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,680
You wanna call him a phony now?

124
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,180
Yes.

125
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,240
Al!

126
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,500
Give that back!

127
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,560
So this is the official pocket watch of
the state alchemist.

128
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,480
Never seen one close.

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,300
It's the reason you can do alchemy
without a transmutation circle, isn't it?

130
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,980
It amplifies all of your work.

131
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
I think you'll be quite
harmless without it.

132
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,040
MUHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHAHAHA!

133
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,720
How could I sleep after last night?

134
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,400
Where's the... bell?

135
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,910
Great, you came to feed me.

136
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,090
And I thought you were mad.

137
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,200
I hope he's real, Rose.

138
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,640
I just don't want you to get disappointed.

139
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,430
The real secret behind that
philosopher's stone stays between us.

140
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,890
Right, love?

141
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:49,320
Sorry, Cain.

142
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,275
I know you're healing.

143
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,020
But I just needed to talk.

144
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,480
So much has happened and I'm confused.

145
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,380
Rose?

146
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,580
I'm sorry, father.

147
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,040
I shouldn't have taken
the key without asking.

148
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,640
I just needed to see.

149
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,380
Oh!

150
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,260
What's wrong, Rose?

151
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,400
You got your wish.

152
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,900
I'm afraid that even with the
stone, I couldn't forge a human soul.

153
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,000
I had to use the
souls of these birds.

154
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,260
You know, they can be quite
adept at mimicking the human voice.

155
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,760
You shouldn't have
acted against me, Rose.

156
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,840
You've fallen out of the Sun God's favor.

157
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,860
Give the real Cain my best.

158
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,220
Rose!

159
00:11:55,221 --> 00:11:56,221
Rooose!

160
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,240
There's only one soul left who
knows the secret of the stone.

161
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,740
But not for long.

162
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,700
I guess I don't need to
tell you it's dangerous here.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,800
Come on.

164
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,880
This little charade of yours
will be found out soon enough.

165
00:12:32,881 --> 00:12:37,360
The faithful are not likely to distinguish
between alchemy and the works of God.

166
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,660
Really.

167
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,100
As long as I'm bringing them happiness,
what do they care where it comes from?

168
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,480
Right.

169
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:47,460
So what's in it for you, besides all the
kowtowing?

170
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,040
It's alchemy's basic principle.

171
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,160
To obtain, you have to give up something
of equal value.

172
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:01,320
People say Ed's a prodigy, but that's just
because he paid with enough effort.

173
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,480
But how did you survive those statues?

174
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,380
Easy, really.

175
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
Ed handled it.

176
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,740
The two of you really have
paid a hefty price, haven't you?

177
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,260
An arm and a leg.

178
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:13,240
A body.

179
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,540
And yet here you are
now, trying to get it all back.

180
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,200
What about your mom?

181
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,820
What happened to her?

182
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,840
I should get started.

183
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:24,720
It's about time.

184
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:27,660
What?

185
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,320
Is it the money you're after?

186
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:30,060
Edward?

187
00:13:30,061 --> 00:13:32,580
Oh, I can get all the money I want from
the offerings.

188
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,760
But you think too small.

189
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:40,500
I'm making believers who would gladly
throw away their very lives in my name.

190
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,420
And why not?

191
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,240
They believe I can resurrect them.

192
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,840
They aren't afraid to die.

193
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,720
There is no greater army
than those with a holy call.

194
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,400
Mark my words.

195
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:54,500
In a few years, I'll have a following
large enough to tear this country apart

196
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,280
and rebuild it in my name!

197
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,040
Makes no difference to me.

198
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
What?

199
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:04,340
After all, there's no real way to bring
people back to life, right?

200
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,380
Once you cut me down, I'm gone for good.

201
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,700
I'm afraid that's right.

202
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:11,380
Even with a Philosopher's Stone,
I wouldn't dare try human alchemy.

203
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,680
I'd end up like you.

204
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,160
And why would a king risk his life for the
sake of his mindless pawns?

205
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,700
Wait a second...

206
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,360
Gee...

207
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,900
WHAT!

208
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,940
How long has that thing been on?

209
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,560
Long enough for the mindless pawns tearing
this country apart comment, I think.

210
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,120
How did you get my broadcasting equipment?

211
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,860
Al rigged it up.

212
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,280
I know, you smashed him into pieces.

213
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,120
But that was just some metal I whipped up
to look like him.

214
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,120
Pretty clever, huh?

215
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,780
No, my children, he lies!

216
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:47,840
Don't believe him!

217
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:02,330
Oh, and by the way, I don't get
my skills from a pocket watch.

218
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,680
Father, that broadcast,
I don't understand.

219
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,000
Tell us what's going on.

220
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,600
My children, the non-believer has used his
science to impersonate me.

221
00:15:31,601 --> 00:15:34,080
It is a conspiracy of the devil!

222
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:38,120
But witness as the great Leto
redeems me with his vengeful light!

223
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,000
Behold God's power!

224
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,800
That has to be a miracle!

225
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,020
What else could it be?

226
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:59,160
I'm warning you, give it up.

227
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,380
You didn't fool me with that little
display down there.

228
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,080
Without this, the only alchemy you
can perform is to your own metal arm.

229
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:06,980
Know what?

230
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,900
You're not the only one who can't stand
doubters preach.

231
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,010
Here's the real Hammer of God!

232
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,520
I don't believe it

233
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:36,120
Not even the philosopher's stone
can move something as big as that.

234
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,900
Rings and watches
have nothing to do with it.

235
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,540
My brother's the Fullmetal alchemist.

236
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,309
AAAAAAAHHHHHHH!

237
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,020
No!
I wont let you have it.

238
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,410
You can't take the stone!

239
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,330
What the?

240
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,350
It's recoiling.

241
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,480
An imitation?

242
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:48,420
After all this... all the trouble you put
me through... even the stones are fake?

243
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,040
Stop jerking me AROOOOOUND!

244
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:03,480
Just another wild goose chase.

245
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,120
And here I thought we could
finally put you back in the flesh again.

246
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,320
No, brother.

247
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,040
You'll be the first we fix.

248
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,780
That automail's so tough on you.

249
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,920
Nothing left to do but
start the search again.

250
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,200
You should never have come here!

251
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,110
Huh?

252
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,020
Father Cornello gave us hope.

253
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,160
What right did you have to take that away?

254
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:28,020
With him, we believed we could do
anything, even bring back the dead.

255
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,980
We're a desert village!

256
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,380
We had nothing before that!

257
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,000
You're saying we should have
just let everything go on as it was?

258
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,900
Well, why not?

259
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,880
What do I have to live for now
that I know Cain won't come back?

260
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:44,360
You tell me that, Ed!

261
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,630
You'll have to decide for yourself.

262
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,170
Walk on your own.

263
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,550
Move forward.

264
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,690
You've got a good,
strong pair of legs, Rose.

265
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,970
You should get up and use them.

266
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,350
Brother was trying to help you.

267
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,910
He just doesn't always
handle things well.

268
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,310
Just go away, would you?

269
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:19,690
You can still believe in hope,
Rose.

270
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,830
I still do.

271
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,800
AHH What's going on here?

272
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,400
That damn boy was right!

273
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,900
The ring you gave me wasn't the real
Philosopher's Stone!

274
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,620
Of course not.

275
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:36,220
This village is nothing but a juicy bait.

276
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,900
As rumors spread, real
alchemists who've searched

277
00:19:39,901 --> 00:19:42,160
for the stone all their
lives will come to me.

278
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,720
And then...

279
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,240
Cursed souls!

280
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,100
Who are you really?

281
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,380
What are you after?

282
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,780
Come on, Lust.

283
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,440
Isn't it time you let me
eat the old preacher?

284
00:19:53,655 --> 00:19:56,955
[Wet macaroni noises]

285
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:03,410
Where'd that miserable preach run off to?

286
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,410
Rotten fake.

287
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,030
I can't believe we were duped.

288
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,010
What do you think that's about?

289
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,430
I don't know.

290
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,650
Something messed
up's been going on here.

291
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,310
Father Cornello?

292
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:29,389
A miracle.

293
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,680
How do you know it's not another trick?

294
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,969
You don't trick things to life.

295
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:37,340
It seems the devil has worked his
wickedness while I was gone away.

296
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,320
But I'm glad that you're all safe.

297
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,980
I knew it, Cornello.

298
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,080
I knew someone who gave us
so many joys couldn't be bad.

299
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,590
Good, Envy.

300
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,270
I'm sorry, but we'll have to ask you
to keep that form for a little while.

301
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,990
Long live Cornello!

302
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,950
Long live Cornello!

303
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,810
Before we go, Rose, listen to me.

304
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:16,630
My brother and I have seen all sorts
of things over our years of searching.

305
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,170
And I need to tell you about them.

306
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,910
So you don't repeat our mistakes.

307
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:31,330
We were born and raised in a small
village east of Central named Resembool.

308
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,390
That's where it all began.

309
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:41,470
Hahahaha
mom, look mom, look

310
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:42,450
What you got there?

311
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,570
See?

312
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:47,590
Brother made it.
Isn't it awesome?

313
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,790
I can still only do this one.

314
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,690
Well, I think they're both gorgeous.

315
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,210
You two really are his kids, all right.

316
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,200
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

317
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,880
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

318
00:22:09,881 --> 00:22:13,640
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

319
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:22,520
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

320
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,080
Fulmetal Alchemist.

321
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,480
Episode Three, Mother.

322
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,200
What I remember most were her lullabies.

323
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:48,740
For Ed, it was her stew, even
though I thought it just tasted like milk.

324
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,480
We loved her more than anything,
and that's why we had to try.
