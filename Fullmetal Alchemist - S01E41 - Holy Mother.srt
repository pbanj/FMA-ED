1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,240
Don't you see?

2
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:12,960
After these people lost Cornelo,
a widespread panic set in.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:16,080
The higher-ups at Central
saw this as a golden opportunity.

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,300
A sanctioned slaughter
disguised as crowd control.

5
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,620
That opportunity was
created because of you, Ed.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,960
And the people of Lior are destined to suffer the
same fate as the Ishbalans if the military has its way.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,780
That's not true.

8
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:44,060
I will complete the Philosopher's Stone and
put an end to this oppression once and for all.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:44,960
Wait!

10
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,220
I said wait!

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
This Chimera was even more advanced
than the ones Tucker was making.

12
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,540
I guess she was all that
was left from Laboratory Five.

13
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,880
I think you knew about this.

14
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,520
You and Lieutenant Colonel Archer
were well aware of what was going on.

15
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:28,431
Come on, Armstrong.

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,080
Spill it.

17
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,736
We have a right to
know what you're hiding.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,420
Stop it.

19
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,340
Al.

20
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,700
Major Armstrong had
nothing to do with this.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,980
I was the one hiding Marta.

22
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,600
What are you talking about Al?

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,600
I can't really go
into it right now.

24
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:53,060
Except to say that all this eye for
an eye stuff, it's never gonna work.

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,500
So please, stop
fighting each other.

26
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,050
Major, I am well aware that you are
only trying to follow in Hughes's footsteps.

27
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,130
Keep heading for the top.

28
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,030
I'll stay here and
support you from below.

29
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:18,510
That's really what you're
wanting to say to me now, right?

30
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:20,150
Old pal.

31
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:26,750
Forgive me, Colonel, but I
don't know what you mean.

32
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:35,640
Al!

33
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,000
Marta!

34
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,160
Listen carefully.

35
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,360
I don't have much time.

36
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,960
Here, get in.

37
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,720
You've got to tell Ed.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,900
Tell him what?

39
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,140
That they're planning on
turning Lior into another Ishbal.

40
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:51,820
What?

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,100
And your leader.

42
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,100
The Führer.

43
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,980
He's a...

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,503
Homunculus!

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,940
We must stand
together, my brethren!

46
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:48,020
Any violence on our part is an open invitation for
those military vermin to authorize destroying us.

47
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,640
Just like Ishbal.

48
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,470
Lure them in, but do not resist.

49
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:03,070
Ishbala's vengeance
shall rain down upon them!

50
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,040
Really classy, Scar.

51
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,160
Using a bereaved mute
woman as your mouthpiece.

52
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,400
She's not just any woman.

53
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,020
She's our divine holy mother.

54
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,640
She's given us all the courage to stand
on our own without the help of a corrupt.

55
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,880
military or false
prophets like Leto.

56
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:28,500
Listen, as long as you're taking orders
from somebody else, nothing will ever change.

57
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,840
What?

58
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,520
You must understand, Ed.

59
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,183
Not everyone can
be as strong as you.

60
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,180
Are you wearing perfume, Lyra?

61
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:50,740
Yeah.

62
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,060
Bathing is a rare
luxury around here.

63
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,320
Yeah, well, the smell's
making me nauseous.

64
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,180
What do you intend
to do about Scar?

65
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,340
Something.

66
00:06:03,465 --> 00:06:05,596
I sure as hell can't let
him go through with this.

67
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,040
I agree.

68
00:06:07,345 --> 00:06:11,140
Despite Scar's best intentions,
there will be civilian casualties.

69
00:06:11,165 --> 00:06:17,480
And if he fails to transmute the soldiers
into the stone, well, that's a risk we can't take.

70
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,560
I don't understand.

71
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,720
I thought you were one
of Scar's biggest fans.

72
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,600
My only true allegiance
is to the people of Lior.

73
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,140
Lyra, I need your help.

74
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,300
I have to send a letter.

75
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,200
It's me, Al.

76
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,440
He arrived this morning from Lior
with a message addressed to me.

77
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,140
Is it from my brother?

78
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:53,960
Is he okay?

79
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:54,880
Yes.

80
00:06:55,320 --> 00:07:00,160
And according to Edward's letter, Scar's
turned the whole city into a transmutation circle.

81
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,640
He's warning us to stay out of
Lior no matter what happens.

82
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:09,260
Sounds like Scar's planning to use the soldiers
as components for the Philosopher's Stone.

83
00:07:10,065 --> 00:07:10,960
What did you say?

84
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:19,180
In order to create the Philosopher's
Stone, you have to sacrifice human lives.

85
00:07:20,241 --> 00:07:21,400
In Scar's method.

86
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,080
Thousands of lives.

87
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,400
No... no way.

88
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,860
So that's what they were actually
using the Laboratory Five for.

89
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,400
I can't believe this depravity's
been going on under our noses.

90
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,160
Al, I want you to head for Lior.

91
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,180
Once you're there, you
can meet up with Ed.

92
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,380
Okay, but... If I can get Bradley to
hold off, Lior will most likely surrender.

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,280
That way we can arrest Scar
before any conflict begins.

94
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,200
All right.

95
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,020
Al, wait.

96
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,740
This belongs to Ed.

97
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,660
Make sure you get it
back to him, all right?

98
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:25,569
All of those foolish
enough to run, shall die.

99
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,270
Talking beasts?

100
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,592
Are you out of your mind?

101
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:33,830
Chimera.

102
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,570
Then it must be them.

103
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,610
There's more.

104
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:40,450
They were with some guy who was
blowing stuff up with his bare hands.

105
00:08:40,670 --> 00:08:41,170
What?

106
00:08:42,251 --> 00:08:43,150
What is it, Scar?

107
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,830
Do not be deceived.

108
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:50,390
They are only trying to provoke
us into making the first attack.

109
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:54,190
Stick to the plan at all costs,
and we shall be victorious.

110
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,550
Now I need you to lead the
people through the escape route.

111
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:04,350
I will stay behind and extinguish the
parasite that's been tormenting your city.

112
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,110
You have an obligation to
get them out of here safely.

113
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,010
Yeah, yeah, I know.

114
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,950
Well, I suppose we
better get going then, huh?

115
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,610
Aren't you worried about
what Scar's planned?

116
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,270
If Mustang got my letter, the
military won't step foot in here.

117
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,910
Without his components,
Scar won't be able to do a thing.

118
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,430
He'll never succeed, Rose.

119
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,430
The only thing left for you to do now is
to get out of here while there's still time.

120
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,210
It's over.

121
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,430
Lior will fall.

122
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,090
You can blame me if you want.

123
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:59,030
I should have tried harder to
find a way to stop their madness.

124
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,698
Excellent.

125
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,650
Looks like all 7,000
men are accounted for.

126
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,390
Lior will be pleading for mercy
before the sun sets tomorrow.

127
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,390
Well, I'm not so sure.

128
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,070
Perhaps we ought to wait.

129
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,250
What do you mean?

130
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,770
According to the letter Colonel Mustang
received, the Fullmetal Alchemist is

131
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,053
still alive and well.

132
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:51,490
I believe it would be in our best interest
to try and solve this thing diplomatically.

133
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,610
But Führer, that's
never going to happen.

134
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:54,430
He's right.

135
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:59,050
Besides, you know we can't launch an assault
on civilians without a legitimate reason, Archer.

136
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:04,570
Pride, I don't
understand this decision.

137
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,050
Fortunately, that's
not your department.

138
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:09,790
Scar is counting on you
to send in those troops.

139
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,550
He has got to have those lives in order
to transmute the Philosopher's Stone.

140
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,290
Yet you seem
hell-bent on fouling it up.

141
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,948
You'll have to take
it up with the boss.

142
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,710
I'm not sure what our master's intentions
are, but I know these orders are absolute.

143
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,144
uh-oh.

144
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,470
Well, that's just
not good enough.

145
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:33,742
If Scar wants to create the
Philosopher's Stone, I'm going to help him.

146
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:39,010
Don't you think you're taking this
infatuated schoolgirl routine a bit too far?

147
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:42,030
We're alive because
of our master.

148
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,580
Don't forget that, Lust.

149
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,100
We aren't alive.

150
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,570
Hence the search
for that damn stone.

151
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,210
I guess I'll have to
take care of this myself.

152
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:56,070
Thanks for nothing, traitor.

153
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,710
Are you coming, Gluttony?

154
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:02,430
Want to, but I'm afraid.

155
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,830
Why are you
running, you cowards?

156
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,150
Even those Ishbalan weaklings put up more
of a fight than this, and that's not saying much.

157
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:22,790
I've overestimated them.

158
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:26,950
I thought surely they would have issued
a counterattack after all that I've done.

159
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,530
Guess I'll have to push harder.

160
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,620
So it is you.

161
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,720
The Crimson Alchemist.

162
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,800
Who the hell?

163
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,720
Ah, now I remember.

164
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:59,680
That scar is definitely
my handiwork.

165
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,600
I thought I'd got your arm.

166
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:08,060
I swore an oath not to kill
another State Alchemist.

167
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,040
But I'll make one
last exception!

168
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,350
Damn.

169
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,180
Oh, now it makes sense.

170
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,820
That's your brother's
old arm, isn't it?

171
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,200
How touching.

172
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,720
Don't bother using those stones.

173
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,360
I'll just absorb their
lives into my arm.

174
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:51,260
And then I'll use them to
create the Philosopher's Stone.

175
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,470
Why do we have
to leave the city?

176
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,930
We should stay and fight.

177
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,430
Because that's not what the
Holy Mother has planned for us.

178
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:07,650
Speaking of plans, Rose, what
are we going to do once we escape?

179
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,350
In the event that Scar
isn't able to succeed?

180
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,470
You'll be just fine.

181
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:13,790
You'll go into hiding.

182
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,490
Enough worrying.

183
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,710
I'm not worrying.

184
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:20,010
I'm just trying to make sure that we
keep moving forward with our struggle.

185
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,570
I know we can't fight now,
but we can do something.

186
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,610
Perhaps we could
alert the other cities.

187
00:14:24,810 --> 00:14:27,150
And we could tell them
about Ishbal and Lior.

188
00:14:27,370 --> 00:14:28,650
We could start a coup.

189
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,070
Talk about a pipe dream.

190
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,270
Even if you manage to get more people on board,
there's no way you could defeat the State's Army.

191
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,520
Lyra, I want you to take Rose
and get out of here right away!

192
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,950
I've been waiting
for you, Edward Elric.

193
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:06,540
Well, well.

194
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,960
It's teachers, kid.

195
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,780
It's Wrath.

196
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,255
Wrath!!!!!

197
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,700
Rose, you idiot!

198
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,060
Run!

199
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,060
Make it stop!

200
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,400
Now!!!!

201
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:49,900
Not so fast!

202
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,420
Rose, get out!

203
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,540
Scar was just using you!

204
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,140
You don't have to die for him!

205
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:56,640
Please go!

206
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,360
Go!!!!

207
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:14,880
I know what the weakness
is for you Homunculi.

208
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:16,880
Greed told me.

209
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,700
You lose strength if you get
close to a certain person's remains.

210
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,020
The one who was supposed to be brought
back in the transmutation that created you.

211
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,520
It makes you realize
that you're fake.

212
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,626
And that's why it hurts when
you're up against the real thing.

213
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,740
Those rules don't
exactly apply to me.

214
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,920
I was transmuted using my
own human body as material.

215
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,120
So you see, I don't
have an actual body now.

216
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,320
But if I had to choose
one, it'd be yours!

217
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:58,075
What the....

218
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,560
Go get some help!

219
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:38,630
Do you really think it wise to be chasing me around like
this when the Military could step in at any moment, Scar?

220
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:42,270
Oh, I think I'll chance it to
avenge my brother, Kimbley.

221
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,670
You're risking your own life for
something as pointless as revenge?

222
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,930
And what is it that
you're killing for?

223
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,350
Nothing.

224
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,130
Nothing?

225
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:53,730
You mean to say you slaughtered
all these people for nothing?

226
00:17:54,015 --> 00:17:59,030
At the end of the day, a human being is not much
more than the components used to create a common bomb.

227
00:17:59,031 --> 00:18:01,790
If you think about it,
we're not that special.

228
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:02,730
Not you.

229
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:03,750
Not me.

230
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,210
We're all empty.

231
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:09,010
We're all worthless.

232
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,750
I might be empty!

233
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,030
But not worthless!

234
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,710
Cut me some slack, Al.

235
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,566
I'm just a state alchemist
trying to do his job.

236
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,730
Just like your brother.

237
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,590
You're just a murderer!

238
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,818
And you've got to stop this.

239
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:36,910
It won't solve anything!

240
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,470
Stay out of it, Al.

241
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:39,418
You don't understand.

242
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:40,950
What will you accomplish?

243
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,970
By shedding more blood.

244
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,000
Please.

245
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,860
Just walk away.

246
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,570
Well, how do you like that?

247
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,750
Looks like I've managed to get
rid of both of your arms, old boy.

248
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,850
Do you smell that?

249
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,150
Smells like defeat.

250
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,130
Any minute now, your arm will begin
to absorb the oxygen from the air.

251
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,030
And then, kablooey!

252
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,490
You say humans have
no impact, no meaning.

253
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,790
So tell me, how much of
an impact I make on you?

254
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:53,180
Scar!

255
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,180
Go and find your brother.

256
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,383
I must do what the
two of you cannot.

257
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:16,785
What were those stones
doing on Ed's watch?

258
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,010
Really, Al?

259
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,250
You didn't expect me to play
without a loaded deck, did you?

260
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,030
Alphonse!

261
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,570
It's gonna be so
magnificent, Al.

262
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:30,470
I can feel your makeup.

263
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:32,110
You'll make such a great bomb.

264
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,430
Farewell, my friend.

265
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:41,490
Hey.

266
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,910
What are you doing here?

267
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,870
Hello, Edward.

268
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:46,690
My son.

269
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,250
Why didn't you
bring me back to life?

270
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,318
Ed.

271
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:17,260
Give me the body I deserve!

272
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:26,790
Stop it.

273
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,310
Shut up!

274
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:30,730
Shut that thing up!

275
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:33,690
Shut up.

276
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,450
Shut up!

277
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,123
Ed.

278
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,994
Get up Ed!
Get up!

279
00:21:48,899 --> 00:21:50,959
And move forward.

280
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,730
Fullmetal Alchemist

281
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,210
Episode 42,
His name is unknown.

282
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,330
It's all happening so fast.

283
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,110
I'm a bomb, all the Homunculi are here, and
could this really be the Philosopher's Stone?
