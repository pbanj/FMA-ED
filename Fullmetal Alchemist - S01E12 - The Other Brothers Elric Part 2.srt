1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,860
Mr. Edward, is everything
all right in there?

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,340
Yeah, I'm fine.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,460
I told them not to
bother me in here.

4
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:11,500
Maybe they don't
really trust you.

5
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,060
Though I can't see why, except for,
you know, you lying about who you are.

6
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:21,513
What the... Fletcher?

7
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:27,129
Run for it!

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,762
Hurry!

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:29,680
Brother...

10
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,780
If they catch you,
we'll all be in trouble.

11
00:00:32,781 --> 00:00:34,380
So please get
out of here quickly.

12
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,644
I promise I'll explain
everything later.

13
00:00:40,133 --> 00:00:41,944
All right, let's go.

14
00:00:57,187 --> 00:00:59,787
You can blame me, brother.

15
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,729
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

16
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,160
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

17
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,996
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

18
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:24,369
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

19
00:03:07,449 --> 00:03:10,282
Fullmetal Alchemist, episode
12. The Other Brothers Elric part 2.

20
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,469
You promised you would never
experiment with alchemy, Fletcher.

21
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,620
You know that Dad
didn't like you doing it.

22
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,020
My lab!

23
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,740
What have they done to my lab?

24
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:25,913
Mr. Mugear.

25
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,866
Oh, I'm glad to
see you're all right.

26
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,280
The stone, has it been damaged?

27
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,540
No need to worry.

28
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,055
It's intact.

29
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,820
It's a decent size.

30
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,429
I commend you
for getting this far.

31
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,480
But I'm afraid that our
timetable's been pushed up.

32
00:03:41,481 --> 00:03:44,660
I need you to move directly
into our contingency plan.

33
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,620
But sir, we've
made real progress.

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,040
We don't need to resort to that.

35
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,720
Are you questioning the only
person who's given you a chance?

36
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,260
No.

37
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,260
No.

38
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,440
There was once another alchemist
who couldn't do what I asked him.

39
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,580
He left here with his tail between his
legs and he was never heard from again.

40
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,460
What is that?

41
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,840
With this machine, even a
non-alchemist such as myself has options.

42
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:18,057
Why are you doing this?

43
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,240
Because I can.

44
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,080
You honestly think
I'm a fool, don't you?

45
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,360
That I don't realize the true
Edward Elric has an automail arm.

46
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,066
Or that you're the
sons of Nash Tringham.

47
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,170
A lot of excitement up at the
mansion tonight, huh boys?

48
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:44,650
You don't say.

49
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,270
The second night in a row.

50
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,390
There's not much
hope for you, is there?

51
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,070
Cough, cough, cough.

52
00:04:50,071 --> 00:04:51,650
Is Elisa still here?

53
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:56,210
Her father's gonna be furious,
but she wanted to stay here.

54
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,770
And like you two, she
won't listen to reason.

55
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,402
I had no choice though with her
coughing like that, so I put her to bed.

56
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,890
Red water.

57
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,770
They want to crystallize it into a
red stone, an alchemic amplifier.

58
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:11,590
Stupid.

59
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:14,790
Compared to the Philosopher's
Stone, it's a cheap imitation.

60
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:16,090
They're wasting their time.

61
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,866
He said his father put his
whole life into that research.

62
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:20,610
Yeah, yeah.

63
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:21,910
Probably another lie.

64
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:25,770
Unless... maybe they're
the sons of Nash Tringham.

65
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:27,010
Nash Tringham?

66
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,210
You mean that
theorist I read about?

67
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,136
The guy who came
up with the idea?

68
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,650
He grew up in
Xenotime, just like me.

69
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,630
He only moved to Central to put his
research together on the Red Water.

70
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,170
He was gone for years.

71
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:42,224
And then one night, he just
showed up again, out of the blue.

72
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,703
It was raining.

73
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,710
Nash Tringham.

74
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,170
You really are back.

75
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,617
Guess I lost that bet.

76
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,550
How are you?

77
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:56,050
The town's worse off
now than when you left.

78
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:00,445
You keep saying we need to give up on
gold, but that's a pill no one wants to swallow.

79
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,990
So how's research on the
Red Water going, Brains?

80
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,190
Any luck yet?

81
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:07,651
Abandoned.

82
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,005
I'll never mess with it again.

83
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:12,724
And I'm not going
back to Central.

84
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:13,650
Ever.

85
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,170
But Nash, what
about your family?

86
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:18,390
I've been a failure.

87
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,746
Both as a good
husband, and a father.

88
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:23,970
No, Nash.

89
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:28,230
He'd left behind everything
that mattered to him.

90
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:31,413
But he wouldn't tell me a word
about what had happened in Central.

91
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,290
He was a wet, wounded
animal, ready to be pounced on.

92
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,310
And the town's biggest land-bearer and
Mugear had made his fortune smell like blood.

93
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,110
Beg me all you want,
the answer's the same.

94
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:52,010
You're going to turn your
back on this town, too?

95
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,591
The mines have dried up and people are suffering,
but your Red Water could make us produce again.

96
00:06:56,710 --> 00:07:00,431
Once we have the gold, the town
will bounce back twice as strong.

97
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:01,684
We need you, Nash.

98
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,930
You could be our hero.

99
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,190
You can still make
something out of your life.

100
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:11,610
Ultimately, he gave in, secluding himself
in Mugear's mind to resume research.

101
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,630
And as the land-bearer promised,
the town was once again lit by gold.

102
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:21,330
Furnaces were aflame, vendors
filled the streets with their wares.

103
00:07:21,797 --> 00:07:23,472
Life returned to the people.

104
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,840
But at the same time, a
mysterious plague began to spread.

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,064
We had all the money we
wanted, but we couldn't buy a cure.

106
00:07:39,424 --> 00:07:43,544
Many, many babies succumbed
to the disease soon after birth.

107
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,840
Elisa, was born then.

108
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,166
When she was a baby, an alchemic doctor named
Marco passed through town and took a look at her.

109
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:04,389
Somehow, she's come
into contact with Red Water.

110
00:08:04,743 --> 00:08:06,183
I'll do whatever I can.

111
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,880
Glowed?

112
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,671
Yes.

113
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,245
The doctor's tool.

114
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,220
Could it have
been the real thing?

115
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:25,271
Whatever it was, we have that
treatment to thank for Elisa's survival.

116
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,352
I hounded Nash all
about the Red Water.

117
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,609
Answer me, Nash.

118
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,520
Before this whole town
becomes a graveyard.

119
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,443
What the hell have
you done here?

120
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,020
It's all my fault.

121
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:41,438
I've brought it out... again.

122
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,480
Sorry, Belsio.

123
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,420
I'm going to stop it.

124
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,880
Once and for all.

125
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,746
But Nash.

126
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,186
That was the last time
anyone ever saw him.

127
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:00,084
Soon after, the gold dried up and the
town was once again on the decline.

128
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,166
If those are indeed Nash's boys, they
must have come here in search of their father.

129
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,186
Or his work.

130
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:11,802
Brother?

131
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,740
What is it?

132
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,933
Is it wrong?

133
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,880
They wanted something to
bring them closer to their dad.

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,260
Oh, please, Al.

135
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,100
They're just using their father
to justify their own selfish causes.

136
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:22,660
Maybe.

137
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,800
But is it really all that
different from what we're doing?

138
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:31,808
All I'm saying is, I
know how they must feel.

139
00:09:42,116 --> 00:09:43,264
You're useless.

140
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,839
You just had to put the
Contingency Phase Two into effect.

141
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:47,632
Brother?

142
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,419
What is Phase Two?

143
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:50,973
Simple, really.

144
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:55,360
You introduce the red water into the
drinking supply of pregnant women.

145
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,359
It permeates their placenta, a
factory of biological condensing.

146
00:09:59,370 --> 00:09:59,630
No!

147
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,910
You shut up!

148
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,488
When the process is done, you
extract it and transmute it into a stone.

149
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:07,150
It's foolproof.

150
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,630
Let's Mother Nature do the work.

151
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:11,990
It's a shame.

152
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:15,070
You have obviously inherited
your father's cowardice.

153
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:16,523
Wait!

154
00:10:16,651 --> 00:10:18,370
Just tell me one thing, Mugear.

155
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,357
Did my father ever use
that method on someone?

156
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,670
No.

157
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:27,111
At the last minute, he had a
crisis of morality and backed out.

158
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,691
If only he had gone through with it,
he would have saved his wretched life.

159
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,790
You liar.

160
00:10:32,183 --> 00:10:33,843
You said that
he left here alive.

161
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:36,170
Wait!

162
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:36,650
Mugear!

163
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,930
Get back here!

164
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:41,663
I've taken care of everything.

165
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:47,370
Now all we have to do is convince the
real Elric brothers to put our plan into motion.

166
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:52,550
You make it sound so easy, but those
boys are more complex than you think.

167
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,630
I can handle a
couple of children.

168
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,750
Please, just put
a little trust in me.

169
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,410
We're close to
the milk and honey.

170
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,350
I can feel it.

171
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,150
It's your gamble.

172
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,270
Go ahead.

173
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,750
One way or the other,
things will work out.

174
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,144
I'm so sorry those
impostors stole your identities.

175
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:18,050
I was completely fooled by them.

176
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:19,690
We all were, I'm ashamed to say.

177
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:22,990
The last thing I want to
do is add insult to injury.

178
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,290
I'm sure you have work to do.

179
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:27,910
But since you two really are such
accomplished alchemists, there's a matter

180
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:28,870
I'd like some help with.

181
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,030
Something with red
water, by chance?

182
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:32,550
Oh!

183
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:34,350
So you have heard about it.

184
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,404
That'll spare me
having to explain.

185
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,450
The truth of the matter is,
I've done my research as well.

186
00:11:39,451 --> 00:11:43,410
And I happen to hear some rumors that
you're very interested in the Philosopher's Stone.

187
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,710
Uh-huh.

188
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:46,050
What do you think, Edward?

189
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,550
It's the product of
crystallized red water.

190
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,230
A prototype for the
prize that you're after.

191
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,110
And so what do I do with that?

192
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,870
First of all, together
we can save Xenotime.

193
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:59,819
Once we revitalize the gold mine,
this town can get back on its feet again.

194
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:01,530
Sounds like a good cause.

195
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,470
So, where are the fakes?

196
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,490
Taken care of.

197
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,630
They're in the cellar.

198
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:10,050
Oh!

199
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,330
What did you do that for?

200
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,570
We'll talk about the
unfinished work later.

201
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,690
First, we execute
those prisoners.

202
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,290
We state alchemists aren't
the type to forgive liars.

203
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,790
Oh!

204
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,550
Then you mean you're accepting
my request for assistance?

205
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:25,530
I told you let's take care
of those pathetic kids first.

206
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,010
It's been a good while
since I killed anyone.

207
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,650
I kinda miss it.

208
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,610
You wanna watch?

209
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,490
Uh, no thanks.

210
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,450
I'll let you take care of it.

211
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:37,670
Hmm...

212
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,020
Brother.

213
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,885
Hi.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,460
Al, what are you doing here?

215
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,660
I know who you guys are now, and I know
that your father was actually Nash Tringham.

216
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,380
What I don't know is why you'd
so foolishly continue his work.

217
00:13:00,327 --> 00:13:02,820
Because... it was his dream.

218
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:06,580
And as his son, it was
my duty to see it through.

219
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,130
So you honestly think
this is what he wanted?

220
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:14,231
You do realize the suffering that toxic water
is causing the people of this town, don't you?

221
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,120
Well, your father realized it.

222
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,520
That's why he chose
to abandon his research.

223
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,940
And I can tell you right now you're not gonna find
happiness by chasing your father's failed dream.

224
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,540
Live your own life.

225
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,540
And stop with all the acting.

226
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,360
Trying to be someone
you're clearly not.

227
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
Come on, Al.

228
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,880
Not to worry.

229
00:13:44,881 --> 00:13:48,120
That was nothing compared to
what these boys will fashion for me.

230
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,900
Which boys?

231
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,760
You mean us?

232
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,920
There's one more thing
I've been wondering.

233
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,120
Whatever happened
to Nash Tringham?

234
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,040
Just in case we have
any questions to ask him.

235
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,100
Nash Tringham?

236
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:03,440
Oh, his research wasn't making
progress anymore, so I had to let him go.

237
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,000
Huh.

238
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:08,560
You don't strike me as the type of guy who
lets someone who knows all of his secrets

239
00:14:08,561 --> 00:14:09,680
just walk away clean.

240
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,945
I'm afraid I missed
the implication.

241
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm saying I don't answer
to murderers, Mugear.

242
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,207
You got that?

243
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:19,806
Really?

244
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:22,493
In that case, you're not
getting out of here alive.

245
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,680
There are plenty of
other alchemists I can use.

246
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:26,600
Another stone?

247
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,436
So he's got more than
one of those things?

248
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,700
It may not be as
potent as that other one.

249
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,740
But it'll do!

250
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,120
Is that all you've got?

251
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,360
Bad question.

252
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Didn't think I had the stones.

253
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:50,960
Ah, crap!

254
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,740
You can't hide for long.

255
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:05,250
Yeah.

256
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,030
I hate to say
it, but he's right.

257
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,090
We need an out.

258
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:08,330
Fast!

259
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,490
Not done yet.

260
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,570
Uh...

261
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,910
Now's our chance, Al!

262
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:21,810
Push!

263
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:36,290
Well Ed, I do hate to interrupt, but it
looked like you needed the help.

264
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:36,989
Nah.

265
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:41,880
We're not going to be chasing
our dad's dream anymore.

266
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,230
You're right.

267
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:46,570
It's time we live our own lives.

268
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:49,286
Uh...Russell...

269
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:51,810
Brother!

270
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,990
A secret passage?

271
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,410
Come on, guys.

272
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:58,630
Time for a chase.

273
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:01,930
Russell!

274
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,010
Not much farther!

275
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,570
The spring where the red
water comes out is just up ahead.

276
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,434
We're almost there.

277
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,870
Mugear blocked our path.

278
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:15,450
He forgot who he's dealing with.

279
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:26,032
I'll never surrender the spring!

280
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,670
As long as I have the red
water, nothing can stop me!

281
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:33,390
Least of all the diminutive state
alchemist and his copycat friends!

282
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:35,069
Ed!

283
00:16:35,183 --> 00:16:35,743
Brother!

284
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,810
Diminutive state alchemist!

285
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:40,750
Points for the big word,
but you're still going down!

286
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,810
Oh yeah!

287
00:16:50,063 --> 00:16:51,511
You see now?

288
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,810
Even with your stones,
I'm on a whole other level!

289
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,770
What's going on?

290
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,530
Ed, that's enough!

291
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,570
Let's get out of here!

292
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:06,670
Brother!

293
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,474
I'll never surrender...
the spring!

294
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:25,860
Rushing water.

295
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,640
The red water's overflowing.

296
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,520
That should hold it for now.

297
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,600
Eh, won't it just come
out somewhere else?

298
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,800
That shock probably
weakened those support beams.

299
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,473
We should leave.

300
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:00,730
Now then. if we could just find a drain.

301
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:28,610
The trees... they're
absorbing all the red water.

302
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,350
I saw something like
this back in the lab.

303
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:33,830
That's right.

304
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:36,570
They were detoxifying
the red water with plants.

305
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,579
See?

306
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,190
It works.

307
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,800
They pulled through.

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:11,700
Well done.

309
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,079
Thank you, trees.

310
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:21,740
Sorry for this.

311
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,742
Take these!

312
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,880
They're from my uncle!

313
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:08,660
Great!

314
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:09,700
Thank you very much!

315
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,855
Stay out of trouble, you guys!

316
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,720
Yeah, and come back to see us.

317
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,140
Sure, of course we will.

318
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:17,141
So are you sure you'll be
able to make it in this town?

319
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:19,960
Belsio wants us
to go work for him.

320
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,711
Our agricultural alchemy should
be pretty useful around his farm.

321
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,331
So, Ed, you'll still hunt for the
Philosopher's Stone after this?

322
00:20:34,423 --> 00:20:34,991
Yeah.

323
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,050
If you want, I can tell you exactly
how we crystallized the red stone.

324
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,183
But why?

325
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:46,790
It's not so much out of atonement,
but just because you deserve to know.

326
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:51,380
Thanks a lot, Russell.

327
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,100
But no thanks.

328
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,820
We'll find the real
article on our own.

329
00:20:55,299 --> 00:20:56,559
You can count on that.

330
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,900
You'll see, Ed.

331
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,780
When you come to visit,
this town will be even better.

332
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,540
That's right.

333
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,460
And by that time, I'll
probably be taller than you.

334
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:05,360
Come on!

335
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,888
Show a little respect
for your elders, huh?

336
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm serious.

337
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,620
Hey, why is that funny?

338
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,920
Come on, guys!

339
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,780
Goodbye!

340
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,280
Bye!

341
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,060
Don't forget to visit!

342
00:21:21,826 --> 00:21:22,379
Goodbye!

343
00:21:37,227 --> 00:21:38,242
Hey, a letter.

344
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:38,980
It's for us?

345
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:39,620
Yeah.

346
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,580
Let me read.

347
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,429
What?

348
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,322
What's it say?

349
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,360
Drop it!

350
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,415
It's nothing, okay?

351
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,500
Oh?

352
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,649
Let me see!

353
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,069
Let me see!

354
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,513
Let me see!

355
00:21:51,524 --> 00:21:52,222
Stay away from me!

356
00:21:52,233 --> 00:21:52,678
I'm serious!

357
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,760
Show it to me!

358
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,140
Hey!

359
00:21:54,162 --> 00:21:55,300
Come on give it back!

360
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:59,940
Ed, thank you for all the help
and words of wisdom you gave us.

361
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,200
I'm sorry I was such a smartass to
you at first, but I am trying to be a better

362
00:22:05,201 --> 00:22:08,960
older brother to Fletcher, and I'll
try hard to follow your example, Ed.

363
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,720
I guess you being a year older
than me makes a big difference.

364
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,280
Well, have a good trip, Russell.

365
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:16,620
Damn!

366
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:20,180
I can't believe he's a year younger
than me and already so much taller!

367
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,760
Life's so unfair!

368
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,300
You think those two
are gonna be all right?

369
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,920
Yeah, they'll be fine.

370
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,620
Maybe we will, too.

371
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:40,070
Fullmetal Alchemist.

372
00:23:40,071 --> 00:23:42,570
Episode 13, Fullmetal vs. Flame.

373
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,790
Colonel Roy Mustang,
the Flame Alchemist.

374
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:49,370
I'm afraid he's more
powerful than my brother.

375
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,470
Like hell he is!
