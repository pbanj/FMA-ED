1
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:20,850
Good luck soldier I
hope you find your man.

2
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:42,130
I can smell the stray dog
Ishbalan but now he's goodbye.

3
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,610
Brother what's going
to happen to Dr. Marco?

4
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,890
Are you worried?

5
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,716
The Fuhrer said that he's
gonna protect him now.

6
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,810
Not much we can do unless
we want to start a new war.

7
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,070
Central Library?

8
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,664
And as a fugitive Marco
must have found a way to

9
00:01:11,665 --> 00:01:14,611
hide his materials right
under the military's nose.

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,810
And the second part, what
do you think that means?

11
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,830
Got me.

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,150
But keep it a secret from the
Colonel and the rest of the state.

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,990
You sure that's a good idea?

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,210
Listen Al, I don't know if
we can trust them anymore.

15
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,890
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,590
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

17
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,030
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,470
In those days we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

19
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,830
Leaving so soon, sir.

20
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,916
Funny how things work.

21
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,280
Now that Scar has shown up here in the
East, the bureaucrats are suddenly very

22
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:37,610
concerned about their
duties back in Central.

23
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,730
I'm sorry for the
inconvenience, you Colonel.

24
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,710
Can you choose
my punishment first?

25
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:43,816
Punishment?

26
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,896
I've known where the Crystal
Alchemist was hiding for some time now.

27
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,370
I've never informed the state.

28
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,570
It was a job well done, Colonel.

29
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:53,830
Sir?

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,010
I've been wanting to put the
good doctor in protective custody.

31
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,636
My second-in-command, the late
Brigadier General, was violently opposed to it.

32
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,430
But as you know, he's the one who ordered Marco
to use his work in battle, against his judgment.

33
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:09,870
This life has been hard on Marco,
and I wanted to make it up to him.

34
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:14,110
But in terms of his research,
sir, we have... That will be all.

35
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,570
I will continue to
rely on you, Colonel.

36
00:04:21,661 --> 00:04:22,791
Have a safe journey.

37
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:28,660
Take my advice, Mustang.

38
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,660
The Philosopher's
Stone does not exist.

39
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,420
You see, I came
out fine as ever.

40
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,160
You know, maybe it would do you some good
to get your hands slapped every once in a while.

41
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,700
Don't blame me.

42
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,006
That guy's a wall.

43
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,180
I can't figure him out.

44
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,440
Creation follows destruction.

45
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:57,620
I'll fix him up nice and pretty.

46
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:01,260
Uh, that's okay.

47
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:05,060
Bonding a soul to steel
is no walk in the park.

48
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:08,020
Full Metal's the only
one who can fix Al now.

49
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:09,006
Go ahead.

50
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,160
Ask him.

51
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:12,446
That's right.

52
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,486
It's my burden.

53
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:15,980
But before I do anything, I
need to get my other arm back.

54
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,330
Well, that is an
interesting fix, isn't it?

55
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,710
I mean, if the great Edward
can't use his alchemy...

56
00:05:20,711 --> 00:05:23,280
He's just a useless teen
with a grumpy-ass attitude.

57
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,926
Anyway, I have to
take some leave now.

58
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,280
I'm going back to my mechanic.

59
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,380
You know the one, don't you?

60
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:32,746
Sure, Ed.

61
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,526
How could I forget?

62
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,300
I saw you in her house, unconscious with
that same stump of an arm you have now.

63
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,246
Balling in your sleep, it hurts!

64
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:41,200
I'm gonna pee my pants!

65
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,540
So tough.

66
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,570
So, where are you gonna
go once you're fixed?

67
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,256
Central.

68
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,570
I've got something to
look up in the library there.

69
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,696
That's a heck of a trip.

70
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,970
You'll need some protection.

71
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,960
I would volunteer, but...

72
00:05:57,961 --> 00:06:02,430
Well, since the Fuhrer's going straight to
Central and I'm part of his escort, I can't go.

73
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,336
They just put me
back in charge here.

74
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,656
I've got to look
after this place.

75
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,370
And I've got to look
after the Colonel.

76
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,271
You could send me, but I
don't know how much help I'd

77
00:06:10,272 --> 00:06:12,750
be up against a fanatical
alchemist serial killer.

78
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,970
Same goes for me!

79
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,610
That settles it.

80
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,116
Sign me up!

81
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,050
I'll protect the boys on their
journey for repairs and investigation.

82
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,870
We don't need an escort!

83
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:24,976
Really, Ed?

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,480
And what do you plan to do?

85
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:28,371
What do you plan to do if Scar
shows up while you're missing that arm?

86
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,696
Can't fight.

87
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,310
Can't exactly carry your
hobbled brother to safety, either.

88
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,050
Children should
listen to adults!

89
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,370
You can't call us children!

90
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,250
Al, why don't you
stick up for us here?

91
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,350
That's the first time anyone's treated
me like a kid since I've been in this armor!

92
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,110
Thank you!

93
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,370
The train leaves
soon, Edward Elric.

94
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,530
We'd better go pack our bags.

95
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:10,730
And this is the first time
anyone's treated me like luggage.

96
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,030
Spacious.

97
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:18,956
Newspaper?

98
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,350
I've got tea, too.

99
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,090
Hey, I got a message from Roy.

100
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:24,350
You mean the Colonel?

101
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,796
He said, don't die
under my command.

102
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,476
You're enough of a pain
without the paperwork.

103
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,276
That was it.

104
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,654
Tell him, fine, there's no
way I'm dying before you

105
00:07:31,655 --> 00:07:34,430
do, you morally bankrupt
Colonel with a God complex.

106
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,170
Tell him to take this guerrilla
escort here off my hands too.

107
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,350
All right, easy.

108
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,730
Look, Ed, I don't know what Marco said to upset
you, but I have some info you might find helpful.

109
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,770
Three years ago, we found the remains of a
young girl who'd been changed into a Chimera.

110
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,150
I'm sure you remember.

111
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,110
Nina.

112
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,130
The way she was torn apart?

113
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,310
Turns out it's identical to
how Scar's been killing people.

114
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,280
Thanks, Hughes.

115
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,960
That does help.

116
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,020
Now I can take him on.

117
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,380
See you in Central.

118
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,141
I'll apply for permission to browse
through the First Branch without restrictions.

119
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,180
Don't mind the
left-handed salute.

120
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:30,540
They're going to Central First
Branch, or something like that.

121
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:32,940
You mean the first branch
of the library in Central?

122
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,620
Now give me back my sister!

123
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,340
Please, forgive me!

124
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,946
What took you so long?

125
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,260
What was the Fuhrer's answer?

126
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,840
You told those boys where
your findings are, didn't you?

127
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,300
I don't know what
you're talking about.

128
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,740
But that's okay, Doctor.

129
00:09:21,010 --> 00:09:24,380
The boy will move even closer
to the Philosopher's Stone now.

130
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,066
However, if you included any
extra information in what you wrote,

131
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,380
that's when I'll get upset.

132
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,366
Edward's much
smarter than you think.

133
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:36,240
Once he understands what I've
written, he won't do what you want him to.

134
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:42,350
And that's exactly why, before he
reads anything, I thought I'd look into it.

135
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:44,580
You won't have the chance.

136
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,740
You're going to die right here.

137
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:49,140
Monster!

138
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,750
That was heartless, Doctor.

139
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,830
After all, isn't dying
once enough for a girl.

140
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,030
Then it is true.

141
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,590
What you creatures
are, like the stories say.

142
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,890
Gluttony.

143
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,910
Huh?

144
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,950
Fair's fair.

145
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:25,096
You told those boys
where to find your papers.

146
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,610
Now you're going to tell me.

147
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,270
I've had enough
of that blowhard, Al.

148
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,996
It just goes on and on and on.

149
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,510
The whole time he's bragging
about his illustrious family background.

150
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,110
I'd rather try my luck
in here with the sheep.

151
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,770
Hey, Al?

152
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,836
Al?

153
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,260
Al?

154
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,391
Al?

155
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,536
You there?

156
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,690
Al?

157
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,636
Major problem.

158
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:57,250
They mistook Al for someone else's
cargo and they dropped him at the last stop.

159
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,370
We'll turn around
at the next station.

160
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,116
Are you crazy?

161
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,310
I can't wait that long.

162
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,590
Yes, you can.

163
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,250
Get off my back!

164
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:07,370
It is important that you
calm down, Edward Elric.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,850
What could I do?

166
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,740
I'm empty armor with
half my pieces missing.

167
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:18,310
If I'd said, don't move me, I'm with
Elric, what would they have done?

168
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,750
Brother will notice, won't he?

169
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,476
No fair, Sky.

170
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,590
I'm the one who
feels like crying.

171
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,590
Nice.

172
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,336
What do you mean he ran off?

173
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,570
He wouldn't have done that!

174
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,776
The armor looks
something like this.

175
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,250
Are you sure that's
what you saw?

176
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,430
Yeah, you're quite a
talented artist there, sir.

177
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,320
The ability's been passed
down the Armstrong line for years.

178
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,350
How can you act so casual?

179
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,910
It's too dangerous.

180
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,070
We can wait here.

181
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,776
None of you can understand us.

182
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,030
We don't operate like you.

183
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,256
What's that mean?

184
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,930
Dr. Marko told us the truth.

185
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,910
We know what all
of you did in Ishbal.

186
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,756
About time I found someone here.

187
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,690
Listen, I'm looking for a suit of
armor that was left by the train.

188
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,690
It's really big and dark gray.

189
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,116
Wait!

190
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,470
Did you see it?

191
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,380
Hospitable.

192
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,700
Hey, get back here!

193
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,520
I said hold on!

194
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:26,440
Didn't your parents
teach you not to steal?

195
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:29,966
Damn it all.

196
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,240
I need more limbs.

197
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,780
It's gonna suck if I have
to start crawling after her.

198
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,876
This isn't good.

199
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,050
We're just getting farther
from the train station.

200
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,450
Hey!

201
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,730
I think I'm hearing voices.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,076
Just one voice.

203
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,230
It's me, the armor.

204
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,540
The stuff I'm
wearing's incredible.

205
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,960
I didn't even get a scratch.

206
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,660
Excuse me.

207
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,940
It's doing it again.

208
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,320
Please don't be scared.

209
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,140
I'm, uh...

210
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,120
I'm the latest model of armor.

211
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:33,060
The sensational Model
S Talking Armor Suit.

212
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,220
We're very popular
in Central right now.

213
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:36,786
Okay, so how do I turn you off?

214
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:37,886
Where's the button?

215
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,846
Uh, you can't turn me off.

216
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:41,000
We're fully automated.

217
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,700
Well then, can you at
least keep yourself quiet?

218
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,740
Where are we going?

219
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:49,140
We suits like to,
uh, plan ahead.

220
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:49,990
To a fight.

221
00:14:49,991 --> 00:14:51,300
A fight?

222
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:57,320
Boss Po said if I wanted to be like him, I should
go prove I'm a man and rub out a couple of guys.

223
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,600
So I told him I'd lay
into the Damesha family.

224
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:03,020
Cause they're always stepping into
our territory, and pushing us around,

225
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,700
and telling us how
tough they are.

226
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,190
If I can bring back one of their heads
looking like this, they'll see that I'm a

227
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:10,986
fighter you listen to, and they
won't treat me like a kid ever again.

228
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,040
And the boss won't have a choice
but to turn me into his right-hand man.

229
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,206
I'll win!

230
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,360
I'll flatten them!

231
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,780
You don't really mean you're
gonna kill anyone, do you?

232
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,110
What, you don't think I will?

233
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,890
You're some pretty good armor.

234
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,470
I won't even have to worry
if they pull a gun on me.

235
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,256
That's why you're wearing me?

236
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,510
So you won't get hurt?

237
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,796
Of course.

238
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,170
Once I know I'm
invincible, I can go all out.

239
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,690
Still, it's gonna hurt.

240
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,690
Why, are you a defective
model or something?

241
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,230
It's going to hurt
you in your heart.

242
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,690
Don't be stupid.

243
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,050
But I can fix that so
you don't feel anything.

244
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,450
That's what you want, right?

245
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,756
Relax your left arm.

246
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,110
Hey, what are you doing to me?

247
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,890
Stop!

248
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,830
I am the cursed wormy arm.

249
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,030
No, wait.

250
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,030
I am the cursed demon armor.

251
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:20,696
Once your body becomes one with my steel, you
will lose all emotion and be a warrior of death.

252
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,810
For I will take your soul.

253
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,010
I'm sorry about this.

254
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,870
It's been tough on her, having to live
out here with an old, broken man like me.

255
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,970
Watching me hobble
around all day long.

256
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,250
It's funny the way a
child's logic can work.

257
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,510
Just trying to make life
easier for a grandpa, huh?

258
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,310
You got a good eye,
noticing the leg, girl.

259
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,010
But I can't give it to you.

260
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,710
I've got my own needs.

261
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,176
If you want, I could point you towards
the engineer who designed it for me.

262
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,310
She's got a sharp
tongue, but decent skills.

263
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:54,210
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't need a fake leg.

264
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,236
Hey, don't knock it.

265
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,830
It's handy once
you get used to it.

266
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,910
Probably so, but
that's not the point.

267
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:06,350
There are more useful things than walking,
and I'd rather keep my leg the way it is.

268
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,990
It was a saber wound,
and it got infected.

269
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,410
By the time they carried me from the front line
to the rear, all they could do was saw it off.

270
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,980
Front line?

271
00:17:21,981 --> 00:17:23,750
Then you were a soldier.

272
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,610
So which war did you fight in?

273
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,850
The North one?

274
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,110
Or was it... Wait, you
mean you went to Ishbal?

275
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,690
Men are not men
on the battlefield.

276
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,370
We turn into some
other creature.

277
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,150
You can do the cruelest things.

278
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,610
Doesn't even matter
if it's an order or not.

279
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,650
To protect yourself, your mind
shuts out any emotions you have.

280
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,290
It's like a steel door.

281
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,650
But once the war is over... You
can't keep it closed anymore.

282
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,770
I can never let myself forget
what I saw there and what I did.

283
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,750
This leg's my constant reminder.

284
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,050
When I look at it, the whole
thing comes rushing back.

285
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,630
That's your reason?

286
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:08,716
You don't want automail that could make you
functional just so you can wallow in your guilt?

287
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,970
That's not the only reason.

288
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,750
It's true I've lost my leg, but
I've gained something in return.

289
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,050
Something much more important.

290
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,410
Quiet.

291
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,090
Peace of mind.

292
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,150
The chance to live
with my grandchildren.

293
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,510
Watch them grow.

294
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,670
It's only after we've given something up
that we obtain the thing we really want.

295
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,256
Isn't that the way
of the alchemist?

296
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,316
Yeah, that's right.

297
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,256
But what about all those men who
went to war and came back in one piece?

298
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,090
That's the whole
dream of a soldier, right?

299
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,230
Those people who came back without a
scratch have lost something just as real.

300
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,670
Even if it's something
you can't see on their skin.

301
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:50,636
Looks like you've had your
share of losses yourself.

302
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,030
Surely you've gained
something back.

303
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:56,770
You do believe in equivalent
exchange, don't you?

304
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,410
But how can that be?

305
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,236
I've spent years
devoted to alchemy.

306
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,590
That damn principle.

307
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:10,350
Getting my arm and leg
back and my brother's body.

308
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,590
That's our dream.

309
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,670
And we keep looking for something
we can do to balance the equation.

310
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,030
To earn it back.

311
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,610
But I've never turned
it around the other way.

312
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,010
Where was the equivalency then?

313
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,750
What have we ever
gained for our losses?

314
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,016
It's always been
a one-way current.

315
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,230
Just a series of us
giving to the void.

316
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,910
Everything's been taken from us!

317
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,460
A dream to get everything
back the way it was.

318
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:43,000
But once you have it, what
will you do with your life?

319
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,840
The pleasure of a
dream is that it's a fantasy.

320
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,820
If it happens, it
was never a dream.

321
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,570
Maybe you're right.

322
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,230
But I still have to try.

323
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:20,700
Thanks for the tea.

324
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,270
Brother?

325
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,710
Grandpa, he's here!

326
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,110
Brother's come back home!

327
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:51,696
Wait a second.

328
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,850
I forgot!

329
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,056
Ow!

330
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,210
Yes?

331
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,490
You're here.

332
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,016
You're aware that you
reek of sheep, right?

333
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:05,960
It's disgusting.

334
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,510
Well, excuse me for being cargo.

335
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,436
A wash-up at Pinako's house.

336
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,590
You happy?

337
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,950
Listen, Al.

338
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,610
You remember when Colonel Mustang
showed up at Risembool, at the Rockbells?

339
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,970
He said he came in response
to one of the letters we sent.

340
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,930
Sure, I remember.

341
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,510
He said he was looking for Dad.

342
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:30,456
Yeah, well, you think
that was his actual reason?

343
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,190
Or was he coming
for something else?

344
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,910
Major.

345
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,850
I was worried about you.

346
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:40,750
It's my fault.

347
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,790
What's the matter?

348
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,610
Sorry, Major.

349
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,710
About earlier.

350
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,870
What I said.

351
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:56,736
That's our train.

352
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,216
If we don't catch it, we'll
have to wait till noon tomorrow.

353
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,370
Come on!

354
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,510
What are you doing?

355
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,560
Time to sprint!

356
00:22:03,561 --> 00:22:08,736
This method of short-distance running has been
passed down the Armstrong Line for generations!

357
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,360
Put me down!

358
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,436
I'm gonna be sick!

359
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,590
And I'm gonna break!

360
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:40,500
Full Metal Alchemist.

361
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,300
Episode 17, House
of the Waiting Family.

362
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:49,801
On the day we left, we burned down our house
and we thought we had nothing to go home to.

363
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,620
But we were wrong.
