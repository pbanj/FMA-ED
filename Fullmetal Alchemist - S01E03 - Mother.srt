1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,720
There aren't any more books
here about the Philosopher's Stone.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,037
Just shoot me in
the head, will ya?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,100
I can't believe that
Cornello Stone was a fake.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,000
Now we're out of leads again.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,260
Mustang's gonna scream my ears off.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,560
Brother, look!

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,520
Introduction to Alchemy.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,580
Takes you back, doesn't it?

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,200
Eh, I guess.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,010
See?

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,210
This line goes here.

12
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,211
Hey!

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,150
I'm bored.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,930
One more second, Winry.

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,710
All right, we're done.

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,530
What do you think, Winry?

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,230
I think that's a lousy present.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,030
Well, that's not the present.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,490
It's just an outline for one.

20
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:36,279
AHHHHHH!

21
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,690
Winry!

22
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,930
That was our very
first use of alchemy.

23
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,930
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,610
To obtain something of equal value must be
lost.

25
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,530
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

26
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,070
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

27
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:54,429
Fullmetal Alchemist: Mother

28
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
They weren't trying to scare you,
Winry.

29
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,600
They went to a lot of trouble.

30
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,500
That's right.

31
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,000
Edward and Alphonse were just
trying to do something special for you.

32
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,300
I'm sorry about this.

33
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,003
It was a misunderstanding.

34
00:04:10,405 --> 00:04:12,180
But no mistake of talent.

35
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:17,080
You know, I found even the most gifted folks
give up before they do anything of real merit.

36
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,440
But your boys have one heck of a start.

37
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,700
Look at this work!

38
00:04:20,701 --> 00:04:22,160
I know, it's stunning.

39
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,804
But they shouldn't know
anything about alchemy.

40
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,020
Well, they are his sons after all.

41
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay boys, no secrets.

42
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,340
When did your dad teach you alchemy?

43
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,480
How can we learn from
somebody who's never here?

44
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,720
We learned it from his book.

45
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,900
You mean you really
understand it on your own?

46
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,300
Yeah, more or less.

47
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,460
So, are you upset with us?

48
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,640
You mean for using alchemy?

49
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,280
No, Ed, I'm proud.

50
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,280
I think I'll brag to everyone I know.

51
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,960
Now be sure to put the books
back where you found them.

52
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,580
We will.

53
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,880
And when your dad gets back, make sure you
thank him.

54
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,280
Okay.

55
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
And that door is off limits, okay?

56
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,520
We hear you!

57
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
There they are!

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,620
Get that one!

59
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
No, you can't pull that one first!

60
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Dad left a long time ago.

61
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:29,000
When Ed and I were still boys,
Mom stared off into the distance a lot.

62
00:05:29,605 --> 00:05:31,720
But she carried on as
if nothing were wrong.

63
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,760
We started studying alchemy,
like our father before us.

64
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,800
The more we learned, the more she smiled.

65
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
She praised us, and we
competed with each other.

66
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,040
We became absorbed in the science
that made you feel like you were magic.

67
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,400
Mom!

68
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,800
Look, Mom, look!

69
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,940
What you got there?

70
00:05:52,041 --> 00:05:53,460
Brother made it!

71
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Isn't it awesome?

72
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:56,700
I can still only do this one.

73
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,740
Well, I think they're
both gorgeous.

74
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,400
You two really are his
kids, no doubt about it.

75
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,200
You think Dad would be proud, too?

76
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Yes.

77
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,440
Once he comes home, he'll tell you so.

78
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,580
Okay.

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,060
I'm going to Winry's!

80
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Brother, wait!

81
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Brother?

82
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,380
Why are you so angry
at Daddy all the time?

83
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,860
Come on, why do you think?

84
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,370
He ditched us.

85
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,500
I can't say I hate him.

86
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
I don't remember him enough.

87
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,880
But when Mom thinks
of him, she gets sad.

88
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,120
That's reason enough not to like him.

89
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,980
I guess.

90
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Come on, let's go show this to Winry.

91
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,930
What do you mean, dead?

92
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,290
Don't be stupid, Al.

93
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,150
They're plain dead, my Mom and Dad.

94
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,440
But how?

95
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,440
I thought they were just doctors.

96
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,080
They went to be surgeons
for the war in Ishbal.

97
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,920
There was a surprise attack.

98
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,510
Wenry, our Dad's gone too, you know.

99
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,550
We make it okay.

100
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,550
Shut up, you idiot.

101
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,730
Your Dad just ran off.

102
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,210
Mom, my parents are both dead!

103
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,970
They can't ever come back!

104
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,290
That's not necessarily true.

105
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,270
I read it in a book.

106
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,470
There's this artificially made
thing called a homunculus.

107
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,390
It's sort of a living doll
without a mind to begin with.

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,842
But some scholars believe with alchemy,
if you're willing to give up enough...

109
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,720
STOP!

110
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,530
There'll be no talking like that in
this house, you understand me?

111
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,530
That's a forbidden science.

112
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,730
Alchemy is not some magic end-all answer.

113
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:58,770
That's why we automail engineers exist!

114
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,290
Backwards, old bat!

115
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,290
You know, she's right.

116
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,830
Winry's already lost more than we ever
will.

117
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,670
Poor Winry.

118
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,450
Can you imagine how that'd be?

119
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,070
What's the matter with you two?

120
00:08:31,425 --> 00:08:32,510
Come on, Ed.

121
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,430
Even you.

122
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,830
My little man.

123
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,730
What could be so bad?

124
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know.

125
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,560
You're gonna beat a
snail with a broken leg!

126
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,430
Hello Mom, sorry we're late!

127
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,740
Mom?

128
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750
Mom?

129
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,660
Mom!

130
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,850
We just have to wait.

131
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,350
I can tell you this isn't some
sickness she contracted yesterday.

132
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,870
She must have been dealing with
this for years, not telling anyone.

133
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Honey...

134
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,300
These are all letters he sent us.

135
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,140
If we mail something to each of
these addresses explaining everything...

136
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,560
Someone is bound to know where
he is and can tell him to come home.

137
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,540
Damn it!

138
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,700
I don't want him here!

139
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,260
But it's the only way.

140
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,200
She has to see him.

141
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,920
Your dad.

142
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,760
He left us money.

143
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,820
I've never touched it.

144
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,020
I was saving it for you boys.

145
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,680
Use it and take care of each other.

146
00:10:01,681 --> 00:10:02,900
Don't be silly.

147
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
We'll use it with you.

148
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,600
Edward, would you be a sweetheart
and transmute something for your mother?

149
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,510
Yes, I know.

150
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,640
A ring of flowers would be nice.

151
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,900
You see, your father always
used to make them for me.

152
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,690
And that's what we finally understood.

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,570
The reason why mom had always smiled at
our alchemy.

154
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,190
It had reminded her of dad.

155
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,720
Brother,
I'm hungry.

156
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,762
And I'm cold too.

157
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,280
How are we going to do this?

158
00:10:58,085 --> 00:11:00,052
How are we going to live without her?

159
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
We're not, Al.

160
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,369
We're going to bring her back.

161
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,980
Look, it's right here in his notes.

162
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,480
I don't understand it all, but he's written
something about human transmutations.

163
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,800
If we can just decipher it...

164
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,160
But Aunt Pinako says
human alchemy is forbidden.

165
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,750
This book says the same thing.

166
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Forget about that.

167
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,340
If scientists could bring people back to
life, we all know we'd be better off, right?

168
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,540
Alchemists tried for centuries and
couldn't figure it out.

169
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,381
Slapping a forbidden label on it was just a
way for them not to feel bad about their failure.

170
00:11:42,812 --> 00:11:43,251
But

171
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,745
But maybe we should ask dad about it
first.

172
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,910
Don't start with that junk again,
Al.

173
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,280
Mom's life drained away waiting for him.

174
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,760
It's all his fault she's dead.

175
00:11:51,761 --> 00:11:54,280
He didn't even come to her funeral.

176
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,343
No, this is something our dad couldn't do,
but we will.

177
00:11:59,156 --> 00:12:00,349
We have to.

178
00:12:03,063 --> 00:12:05,360
We used some of the money to find
ourselves a teacher.

179
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,160
And we learned alchemy from page one.

180
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,040
The serious kind.

181
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,554
We were done making dolls and roses.

182
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,220
Water, 35 liters.

183
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,800
Carbon, 20 kilograms.

184
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,320
Ammonia, 4 liters.

185
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,520
Lime, 1.5 kilograms.

186
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,233
Phosphorus, 800 grams

187
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,340
Salt, 250 grams.

188
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,880
Saltpeter, 100.

189
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,420
Sulfur, 80.

190
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,580
Fluorine, 7.5.

191
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,880
Iron, 5.

192
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,420
Silicone, 3 grams.

193
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:34,963
And trace amounts of 15 other elements.

194
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah, that's everything.

195
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,960
The physical ingredients of a human body.

196
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,441
Now if we can just put together a soul, we should
be able to calm mom back from the other side.

197
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,760
Edward, you sure we should do this?

198
00:12:48,761 --> 00:12:49,189
Of course.

199
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,782
Don't wimp out on me now.

200
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:51,209
But.

201
00:12:51,528 --> 00:12:52,901
No one's ever done this right.

202
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,135
I mean, alchemy is equivalent exchange.

203
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,240
The body content seems simple enough,
but what about the soul?

204
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
What could we possibly offer?

205
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,846
Just hold out your finger, okay?

206
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,500
It's a soul, really.

207
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,980
When you take out the myth,
it's just the spark that starts life.

208
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,580
This is our blood.

209
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,220
From her blood.

210
00:13:19,368 --> 00:13:20,575
That's a fair trade.

211
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:32,690
There's something
foul in the air.

212
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,542
Brother, something's
going wrong here.

213
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:02,469
AAAAAAAAAAAAA!!

214
00:14:05,028 --> 00:14:05,534
AL!

215
00:14:11,346 --> 00:14:12,636
EDWARD!!

216
00:14:14,951 --> 00:14:16,707
Brother!
Brother!

217
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,562
Brother, please!

218
00:14:19,846 --> 00:14:21,240
NO AL!

219
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,811
And that's the last thing I remember.

220
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,639
Him.

221
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,770
Reaching for me.

222
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,540
His leg already broken
down by the forces of alchemy.

223
00:14:44,044 --> 00:14:44,844
Huh?

224
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,127
What is this?

225
00:14:52,621 --> 00:14:54,710
I'm sorry, Al.

226
00:14:56,565 --> 00:14:57,371
Brother!

227
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:00,842
What happened to you?

228
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:02,603
And me?

229
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,184
What happened to me?

230
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:06,126
There wasn't much time.

231
00:15:07,446 --> 00:15:10,984
I used my right arm as
material in a transmutation.

232
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,606
All I could manage was to attach
your spirit to the armor in the corner.

233
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,510
Oh, no.

234
00:15:17,648 --> 00:15:20,936
But... what about mom?

235
00:15:21,008 --> 00:15:22,025
You shouldn't look.

236
00:15:23,227 --> 00:15:24,214
It wasn't human.

237
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:28,409
Huh?

238
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,789
I don't understand, Ed.

239
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:31,872
What happened?

240
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,974
Your theorems and equations.

241
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,280
They all seem right.

242
00:15:35,281 --> 00:15:37,707
The theorems weren't the problem,
Al.

243
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,678
It wasn't the math.

244
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,089
It was us.

245
00:15:44,368 --> 00:15:45,107
Please.

246
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,568
Help him.

247
00:15:48,415 --> 00:15:49,926
He's gonna bleed to death.

248
00:15:51,604 --> 00:15:52,360
Al?

249
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:53,360
Is that you?

250
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,530
We didn't even know you were back from
training.

251
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,620
How did all this happen, Al?

252
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:05,103
Well, clearly, it's a product of mischief.

253
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,563
You were trying to bring back your mother,
weren't you?

254
00:16:09,887 --> 00:16:11,554
Well, that explains a few things.

255
00:16:12,195 --> 00:16:13,498
A human transmutation.

256
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,980
I've never seen such a furious reaction
before.

257
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Pardon me.

258
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:22,369
A state alchemist?

259
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,336
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,400
I have no time to entertain dogs.

261
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,881
Can't you see these boys are hurt?

262
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,280
Take it easy, ma'am.

263
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm just checking the mail.

264
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,023
One of our letters!

265
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,560
Then you know where my dad is?

266
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,240
I only wish, kid.

267
00:16:35,564 --> 00:16:37,380
We've been looking for
Hohenheim for a long time.

268
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:39,180
And we're still only kicking up dirt.

269
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,670
Well, if you didn't have any
information, why did you come?

270
00:16:42,914 --> 00:16:45,331
You sure as heck aren't
going to find their dad here.

271
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,306
Let's call it nostalgia
or misplaced curiosity.

272
00:16:48,585 --> 00:16:50,290
Whatever it was, I'm happy I came.

273
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:57,249
If these boys can try human alchemy and survive,
their dad just dropped a rung on my priority list.

274
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,144
I want you out of this house immediately!

275
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,244
I've had enough lives
wrecked by the state!

276
00:17:04,465 --> 00:17:07,008
The name's Lieutenant Colonel Roy Mustang.

277
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,280
State alchemist.

278
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,340
Pay me a visit at Central sometime.

279
00:17:40,074 --> 00:17:41,202
Good morning, Winry.

280
00:17:41,213 --> 00:17:41,780
EEEEK!

281
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,020
Al!
You're on!

282
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
I mean, you're awake!

283
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:45,282
I'm sorry...
I was just...

284
00:17:45,326 --> 00:17:46,110
And and would've...

285
00:17:46,121 --> 00:17:47,640
But I can't... um...

286
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,240
There's some money in the house.

287
00:17:50,829 --> 00:17:51,699
In a closet.

288
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm sure it's safe.

289
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,223
There are more important
things to worry about right now.

290
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,630
That's not what I'm saying.

291
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:59,445
I want you to take it as payment.

292
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,940
For auto mail.

293
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,681
I can't go through my plan
lugging around a couple of stumps.

294
00:18:06,275 --> 00:18:10,051
I'm going to visit that man Mustang
and become a state alchemist.

295
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,039
I was hoping you weren't
conscious to hear that talk.

296
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,288
He's not the only one I've heard from.

297
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,986
The teacher we had told us about state
alchemists.

298
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,846
They've got access to the Federal Library in
Central with books on alchemy no one else has.

299
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:28,341
They'll pay you and fund your research and
those pocket watches amplify alchemic reactions.

300
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,361
Please tell me that's not all your teacher
said.

301
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,820
What about state alchemists being the
military's attack dogs called into war to

302
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,912
mow down the lives of people the state
tells you are bad?

303
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,276
Did your teacher mention that?

304
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,748
In the attacks that took the lives of my
sons, there were alchemists involved.

305
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:48,354
When war comes again, are you ready to do
the same?

306
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:51,209
I don't want to be chained to the state
any more than you.

307
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,029
But I'll do whatever it takes to fix
things.

308
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,260
Fix you or the world.

309
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:58,601
Make sure you ask yourself that.

310
00:18:58,995 --> 00:19:01,278
Just bear with us, Ed.

311
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,900
It's the highest quality
procedure you can do.

312
00:19:07,262 --> 00:19:09,202
Stay out of the room, Al.

313
00:19:09,467 --> 00:19:10,927
I'm impressed, Ed.

314
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,482
Even adults scream in
this part of the operation.

315
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,426
We're attaching each one of
your nerves to the mechanism.

316
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,100
This paints nothing...
compared to what he's given up.

317
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,335
It's been enough time.

318
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,890
We should see what we can do.

319
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:42,524
To train the mind to its
potential, you gotta train the body.

320
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,090
That's what our teacher said.

321
00:19:44,493 --> 00:19:45,393
But I don't know.

322
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,167
How good can you be
as an empty heap of steel?

323
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,367
Better than a couple chunks
of auto-mail, I know that.

324
00:20:06,307 --> 00:20:09,427
Brother, are you serious
about being a state alchemist?

325
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm serious about trying.

326
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,280
I'm gonna see this Mustang guy.

327
00:20:13,619 --> 00:20:14,891
And find out if I have a shot.

328
00:20:14,969 --> 00:20:16,649
I don't want you to join.

329
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,720
I've made up my mind.

330
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Then I will, too.

331
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,800
You can't.

332
00:20:21,732 --> 00:20:25,387
Brother, are you going to
try to bring back Mom again?

333
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,506
I mean, we agreed it
was a mistake, right?

334
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,240
All the bad things that happened.

335
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,604
I'll become the state alchemist.

336
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,920
And I'll find a way to
get you back to normal.

337
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,660
With a real arm and leg again.

338
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,560
Then you can forget about all these
other things you say you have to do.

339
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,340
It's not your burden to carry,
Al.

340
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:48,706
Well, why shouldn't it be?

341
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,081
I wanted you to stop, but I went along
with it anyway.

342
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm the one who had the feeling I should
have acted on it.

343
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,663
And then you gave up your arm to save me.

344
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,120
You've got no place feeling sorry for me,
Al, okay?

345
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,181
But, Brother... I'm serious.

346
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,440
I'm the one who has to fix things and get
your body back.

347
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:13,625
Then?

348
00:21:14,003 --> 00:21:15,589
You won't try with Mom again?

349
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,432
Well, chances are there isn't anything in
this world we could trade for Mom's soul.

350
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,480
And besides all that...

351
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
I don't...

352
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,380
I don't want to risk losing you again,
Al.

353
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Good.

354
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,016
I'll have to come with you, though.

355
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Why's that?

356
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,820
You're no good without me.

357
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,420
You just turn into a jerk.

358
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,120
Thanks for the endorsement.

359
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,220
But seriously, we're all we've got.

360
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,611
From now on... we can't do
anything that could pull us apart.

361
00:21:56,795 --> 00:21:59,820
Even though we were trying
to restore our own bodies...

362
00:21:59,821 --> 00:22:03,296
it was still human
transmutation we were after.

363
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,627
A forbidden science.

364
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,893
If we failed the next time...

365
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,574
there would probably
be nothing left of us.

366
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:13,263
We had no idea what
the future would hold.

367
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,000
But we knew there was no turning back.

368
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:23,627
So... on the day we left... we burned down the
family home... and all the familiar things inside.

369
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,120
Because some memories...

370
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,258
aren't meant to leave traces.

371
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,458
Full Metal Alchemist
Episode 4 A Forger's Love.

372
00:23:43,475 --> 00:23:45,730
In a forest village a man confronts

373
00:23:45,731 --> 00:23:47,750
his foolishness... when
a doll comes to life.

374
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,070
But he'll repeat his same mistakes,
if alchemy can bring him love.
