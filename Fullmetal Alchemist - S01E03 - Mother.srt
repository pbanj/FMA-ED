1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,720
There aren't any more books
here about the Philosopher's Stone.

2
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:07,840
Just shoot me in
the head, will ya?

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,100
I can't believe that
Cornello’s Stone was a fake.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,000
Now we're out of leads again.

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,260
Mustang's gonna
scream my ears off.

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,560
Brother, look!

7
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,520
Introduction to Alchemy.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,580
Takes you back, doesn't it?

9
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,200
Eh, I guess.

10
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:38,010
See?

11
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:39,210
This line goes here.

12
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:40,210
Hey!

13
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:42,150
I'm bored!

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,930
One more second, Winry.

15
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,710
All right, we're done.

16
00:00:46,270 --> 00:00:47,530
What do you think, Winry?

17
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,230
I think that's a lousy present.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,030
Well, that's not the present.

19
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,490
It's just an outline for one.

20
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,280
[Winry screams]

21
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,310
[Barking]

22
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:41,690
Winry!

23
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,930
That was our very
first use of alchemy.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,930
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

25
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,610
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

26
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:00,530
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

27
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:08,070
In those days, we really believed that
to be the world's one, and only, truth.

28
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:21,460
Take the memories of distant days,
tear them up with your own hands,

29
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:30,500
and squeeze the life
out of your sorrows for me

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,930
Come on, and pierce my
heart as it yearns for your love!

31
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:43,330
Looking at the sky, thinking
tomorrow must be coming,

32
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:50,830
it's too much for my
captivated heart to take

33
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:54,580
As a bird flutters
along beside me,

34
00:02:54,780 --> 00:03:01,680
I wonder where he
managed to find his light

35
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:12,290
Say, would you carry me
along on your back as well?

36
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:19,680
And leave me at the
highest place there is,

37
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,570
far away from kindness?

38
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:34,940
Take the memories of distant days,
tear them up with your own hands,

39
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:43,780
and squeeze the life
out of your sorrows for me

40
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,480
Come on, and pierce my
heart as it yearns for your love!

41
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,430
Fullmetal Alchemist: Mother

42
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,800
They weren't trying
to scare you, Winry.

43
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,600
They went to a lot of trouble.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,500
That's right.

45
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,000
Edward and Alphonse were just
trying to do something special for you.

46
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,300
I'm sorry about this.

47
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,000
It was a misunderstanding.

48
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:12,180
But no mistake of talent.

49
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,830
You know, I’ve found
even the most gifted folks

50
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:17,080
give up before they do
anything of real merit.

51
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,440
But your boys have
one heck of a start.

52
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,700
Look at this work!

53
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,160
I know, it's stunning.

54
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,800
But they shouldn't know
anything about alchemy.

55
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,020
Well, they are
his sons after all.

56
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,480
Okay boys, no secrets.

57
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,340
When did your dad
teach you alchemy?

58
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,480
How can we learn from
somebody who's never here?

59
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,720
We learned it from his book.

60
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,900
You mean you really
understand it on your own?

61
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,300
Yeah, more or less.

62
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,460
So, are you upset with us?

63
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,640
You mean for using alchemy?

64
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,280
No, Ed, I'm proud.

65
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:01,280
I think I'll brag to
everyone I know.

66
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,960
Now, be sure to put the books
back where you found them.

67
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:04,580
We will.

68
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,880
And when your dad gets
back, make sure you thank him.

69
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,280
Okay.

70
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
And that door is
off limits, okay?

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,520
We hear you!

72
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,920
There they are!

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,620
Get that one!

74
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,320
No, you can't
pull that one first!

75
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,640
Dad left a long time ago.

76
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:29,000
When Ed and I were still boys,
Mom stared off into the distance a lot.

77
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,720
But she carried on as
if nothing were wrong.

78
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,760
We started studying alchemy,
like our father before us.

79
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,800
The more we learned,
the more she smiled.

80
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,120
She praised us, and we
competed with each other.

81
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,040
We became absorbed in the science
that made you feel like you were magic.

82
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,400
Mom!

83
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:50,800
Look, Mom, look!

84
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,940
Whatcha got there?

85
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,460
Brother made it!

86
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Isn't it awesome?

87
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,700
I can still only do this one.

88
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,740
Well, I think they're
both gorgeous.

89
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,400
You two really are his
kids, no doubt about it.

90
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,200
You think Dad
would be proud, too?

91
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,440
Yes.

92
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,440
Once he comes
home, he'll tell you so.

93
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,580
Okay.

94
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,060
I'm going to Winry's!

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,000
Brother, wait!

96
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
Brother?

97
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,380
Why are you so angry
at Daddy all the time?

98
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:31,860
Come on, why do you think?

99
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,370
He ditched us.

100
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,500
I can't say I hate him.

101
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,160
I don't remember him enough.

102
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,880
But when Mom thinks
of him, she gets sad.

103
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,120
That's reason
enough not to like him.

104
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:44,980
I guess.

105
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,040
Come on, let's go
show this to Winry.

106
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,930
What do you mean “dead”?

107
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,290
Don't be stupid, Al.

108
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,150
They're plain dead,
my mom and dad.

109
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,440
But how?

110
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,440
I thought they
were just doctors.

111
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,080
They went to be surgeons
for the war in Ishbal.

112
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:17,920
There was a surprise attack.

113
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,510
Winry, our dad’s
gone too, you know.

114
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:24,550
We make it okay.

115
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,550
Shut up, you idiot.

116
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,730
Your dad just ran off.

117
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,210
My parents are both dead!

118
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,970
They can't ever come back!

119
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,290
That's not necessarily true.

120
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,270
I read it in a book.

121
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,470
There's this artificially made
thing called a homunculus.

122
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,390
It's sort of a living doll
without a mind to begin with.

123
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,840
But some scholars believe, with
alchemy, if you're willing to give up enough...

124
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,720
STOP!

125
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:50,530
There'll be no talking like that in
this house, you understand me?

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,530
That's a forbidden science.

127
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,730
Alchemy is not some
magic end-all answer.

128
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,770
That's why we
automail engineers exist!

129
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,290
Backwards old bat!

130
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,290
You know, she's right.

131
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,830
Winry's already lost
more than we ever will.

132
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,670
Poor Winry.

133
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,450
Can you imagine how that'd be?

134
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,070
What's the matter with you two?

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,510
Come on, Ed.

136
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,430
Even you.

137
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:34,830
My little man.

138
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,730
What could be so bad?

139
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,000
Come on, Al!

140
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,560
You couldn’t beat a
snail with a broken leg!

141
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,430
Hello, Mom, sorry we're late!

142
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,740
Mom?

143
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750
Mom?

144
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,660
Mom!

145
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,850
We just have to wait.

146
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,350
I can tell you this isn't some
sickness she contracted yesterday.

147
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,870
She must have been dealing with
this for years, not telling anyone.

148
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,320
Honey...

149
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,300
These are all
letters he sent us.

150
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:38,140
If we mail something to each of
these addresses explaining everything...

151
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,560
Someone is bound to know where
he is and can tell him to come home.

152
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,540
Damn it!

153
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,700
I don't want him here!

154
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,260
But it's the only way.

155
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,200
She has to see him.

156
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,920
Your dad.

157
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,760
He left us some money.

158
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,820
I've never touched it.

159
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,020
I was saving it for you boys.

160
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,680
Use it and take
care of each other.

161
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,900
Don't be silly.

162
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,020
We'll use it with you.

163
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,600
Edward, would you be a sweetheart
and transmute something for your mother?

164
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,510
Yes, I know.

165
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,640
A ring of flowers would be nice.

166
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,900
You see, your father always
used to make them for me.

167
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,690
And that's what we
finally understood.

168
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,570
The reason why mom had
always smiled at our alchemy.

169
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,190
It had reminded her of dad.

170
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:52,720
Brother, I'm hungry.

171
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,760
And I'm cold too.

172
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,280
How are we going to do this?

173
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,050
How are we going
to live without her?

174
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,840
We're not, Al.

175
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,370
We're going to bring her back.

176
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,980
Look, it's right
here in his notes.

177
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:21,480
I don't understand it all, but he's written
something about human transmutations.

178
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,800
If we can just decipher it...

179
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:27,160
But Aunt Pinako says
human alchemy is forbidden.

180
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:28,750
This book says the same thing.

181
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,560
Forget about that.

182
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,340
If scientists could bring people back to
life, we all know we'd be better off, right?

183
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,540
Alchemists tried for centuries
and couldn't figure it out.

184
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:42,380
Slapping a forbidden label on it was just a
way for them not to feel bad about their failure.

185
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,250
But--

186
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,750
But maybe we should
ask dad about it first.

187
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,910
Don't start with
that junk again, Al.

188
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,280
Mom's life drained
away waiting for him.

189
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,760
It's all his fault she's dead.

190
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,280
He didn't even
come to her funeral.

191
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:58,340
No, this is something our
dad couldn't do, but we will.

192
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,350
We have to.

193
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,360
We used some of the money
to find ourselves a teacher.

194
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,160
And we learned
alchemy from page one.

195
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,040
The serious kind.

196
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,550
We were done
making dolls and roses.

197
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,220
Water, 35 liters.

198
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,800
Carbon, 20 kilograms.

199
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,320
Ammonia, 4 liters.

200
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:20,520
Lime, 1.5 kilograms.

201
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,230
Phosphorus, 800 grams

202
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,340
Salt, 250 grams.

203
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,880
Saltpeter, 100.

204
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:27,420
Sulfur, 80.

205
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,580
Fluorine, 7.5.

206
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,880
Iron, 5.

207
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,420
Silicone, 3 grams.

208
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,960
And trace amounts
of 15 other elements.

209
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,040
Yeah, that's everything.

210
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,960
The physical ingredients
of a human body.

211
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,440
Now if we can just put together a soul, we
should be able to calm mom back from the other side.

212
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,760
Edward, you sure
we should do this?

213
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:49,190
Of course.

214
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,780
Don't wimp out on me now.

215
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,210
But--

216
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,900
No one's ever done this right.

217
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,140
I mean, alchemy is
equivalent exchange.

218
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,240
The body content seems simple
enough, but what about the soul?

219
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,960
What could we possibly offer?

220
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,850
Just hold out your finger, okay?

221
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,500
What's a soul, really?

222
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,980
When you take out the myth,
it's just the spark that starts life.

223
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,580
This is our blood.

224
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,220
From her blood.

225
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,580
That's a fair trade.

226
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,690
There's something
foul in the air.

227
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:58,540
Brother, something's
going wrong here.

228
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,770
[Al, Screaming]

229
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,530
AL!

230
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:12,640
EDWARD!!

231
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,350
[Crying out]

232
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,560
Brother!

233
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,710
Brother!

234
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,560
Brother, please!

235
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,240
NO--AL!!

236
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,020
[He screams]

237
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,810
And that's the last
thing I remember.

238
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,640
Him.

239
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,770
Reaching for me.

240
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,540
His leg already broken
down by the forces of alchemy.

241
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:41,340
Ngh...Ugh...

242
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:44,840
Huh?

243
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:46,130
What is this?

244
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,470
[Whimpering]

245
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,090
Uh?

246
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,010
I'm sorry, Al.

247
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,370
Brother!

248
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,840
What happened to you?

249
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,600
And me?

250
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,180
What happened to me?

251
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,130
There wasn't much time.

252
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:10,980
I used my right arm as
material in a transmutation.

253
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:15,610
All I could manage was to attach
your spirit to the armor in the corner.

254
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,510
Oh, no.

255
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,940
But... what about mom?

256
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,030
You shouldn't look.

257
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,210
It wasn't human.

258
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,410
Huh?

259
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,790
I don't understand, Ed.

260
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,870
What happened?

261
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,970
Your theorems and equations.

262
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,280
They all seemed right.

263
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,710
The theorems
weren't the problem, Al.

264
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,680
It wasn't the math.

265
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,090
It was us.

266
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,110
Please.

267
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,570
Help him.

268
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,930
He's gonna bleed to death.

269
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,360
Al?

270
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Is that you?

271
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,530
We didn't even know you
were back from training.

272
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,620
How did all this happen, Al?

273
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,100
Well, clearly, it's a
product of mischief.

274
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,560
You were trying to bring
back your mother, weren't you?

275
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,550
Well, that explains
a few things.

276
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,500
A human transmutation.

277
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,980
I've never seen such a
furious reaction before.

278
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,240
Pardon me.

279
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,370
A state alchemist?

280
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,340
What are you doing here?

281
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,400
I have no time
to entertain dogs.

282
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,880
Can't you see
these boys are hurt?

283
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,280
Take it easy, ma'am.

284
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,840
I'm just checking the mail.

285
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,020
One of our letters!

286
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,560
Then you know where my dad is?

287
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,240
I only wish, kid.

288
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,380
We've been looking for
Hohenheim for a long time.

289
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,180
And we're still
only kicking up dirt.

290
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,670
Well, if you didn't have any
information, why did you come?

291
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,330
You sure as heck aren't
going to find their dad here.

292
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,310
Let's call it nostalgia
or misplaced curiosity.

293
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,290
Whatever it was,
I'm happy I came.

294
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:54,180
If these boys can try
human alchemy and survive,

295
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,250
their dad just dropped
a rung on my priority list.

296
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,140
I want you out of this
house immediately!

297
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:03,240
I've had enough lives
wrecked by the state!

298
00:17:04,470 --> 00:17:07,010
The name's Lieutenant
Colonel Roy Mustang.

299
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,280
State alchemist.

300
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,340
Pay me a visit at
Central sometime.

301
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,200
Good morning, Winry.

302
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:41,780
[She squeals]

303
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,020
Al! You're on!

304
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,080
I mean, you're awake!

305
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,280
I'm sorry... I was just...

306
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,110
I-I would've...

307
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,640
But I can't... um...uh…

308
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,240
There's some money in the house.

309
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,700
In a closet.

310
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,360
I'm sure it's safe.

311
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,220
There are more important
things to worry about right now.

312
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,630
That's not what I'm saying.

313
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,450
I want you to
take it as payment.

314
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,940
For automail.

315
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:05,680
I can't go through my plan
lugging around a couple of stumps.

316
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:10,050
I'm going to visit that man Mustang
and become a state alchemist.

317
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,040
I was hoping you weren't
conscious to hear that talk.

318
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,290
He's not the only
one I've heard from.

319
00:18:15,610 --> 00:18:17,990
The teacher we had told
us about state alchemists.

320
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,850
They've got access to the Federal Library in
Central with books on alchemy no one else has.

321
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:28,340
They'll pay you and fund your research and
those pocket watches amplify alchemic reactions.

322
00:18:29,790 --> 00:18:32,360
Please tell me that's
not all your teacher said.

323
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,820
What about state alchemists being the
military's attack dogs called into war to

324
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:39,910
mow down the lives of people
the state tells you are bad?

325
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,280
Did your teacher mention that?

326
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:45,750
In the attacks that took the lives of my
sons, there were alchemists involved.

327
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,350
When war comes again,
are you ready to do the same?

328
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,210
I don't want to be chained to
the state any more than you.

329
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,030
But I'll do whatever
it takes to fix things.

330
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,260
Fix you or the world?

331
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,600
Make sure you ask yourself that.

332
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,600
Just bear with us, Ed.
[Ed cries out]

333
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:06,060
It's the highest quality procedure
we can do. 
[He cries out]

334
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,200
Stay out of the room, Al.

335
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,930
I'm impressed, Ed.

336
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,480
Even adults scream in
this part of the operation.

337
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,430
We're attaching each one of
your nerves to the mechanism.

338
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:21,100
This pain’s nothing...
compared to what he's given up.

339
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,340
It's been enough time.

340
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:38,890
We should see what we can do.

341
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:42,520
To train the mind to its
potential, you gotta train the body.

342
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,090
That's what our teacher said.

343
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,390
But I don't know…

344
00:19:45,410 --> 00:19:48,170
How good can you be
as an empty heap of steel?

345
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,370
Better than a couple chunks
of automail, I know that.

346
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,430
Brother, are you serious
about being a state alchemist?

347
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,120
I'm serious about trying.

348
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,280
I'm gonna see this Mustang guy.

349
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,890
And find out if I have a shot.

350
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:16,650
I don't want you to join.

351
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,720
I've made up my mind.

352
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,720
Then I will, too.

353
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,800
You can't.

354
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,390
Brother, are you going to
try to bring back Mom again?

355
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:28,510
I mean, we agreed it
was a mistake, right?

356
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,240
All the bad things
that happened...

357
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,600
I'll become a state alchemist.

358
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,920
And I'll find a way to
get you back to normal.

359
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,660
With a real arm and leg again.

360
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,560
Then you can forget about all these
other things you say you have to do.

361
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,340
It's not your
burden to carry, Al.

362
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,710
Well, why shouldn't it be?

363
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:52,080
I wanted you to stop, but I
went along with it anyway.

364
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:55,640
I'm the one who had the
feeling, I should have acted on it.

365
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,660
And then you gave up
your arm to save me.

366
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,120
You've got no place feeling
sorry for me, Al, okay?

367
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:09,180
But, Brother... I'm serious.

368
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,440
I'm the one who has to fix
things and get your body back.

369
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,630
Then?

370
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,590
You won't try with Mom again?

371
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:20,430
Well, chances are there isn't anything in
this world we could trade for Mom's soul.

372
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,480
And besides all that...

373
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,240
I don't...

374
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,380
I don't want to risk
losing you again, Al.

375
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,100
Good.

376
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,020
I'll have to come
with you, though.

377
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,400
Why's that?

378
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,820
You're no good without me.

379
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,420
You just turn into a jerk.

380
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,120
Thanks for the endorsement.

381
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,220
But seriously,
we're all we've got.

382
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:45,610
From now on... we can't do
anything that could pull us apart.

383
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,820
Even though we were trying
to restore our own bodies...

384
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,300
it was still human
transmutation we were after.

385
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,630
A forbidden science.

386
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,890
If we failed the next time...

387
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,570
there would probably
be nothing left of us.

388
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,260
We had no idea what
the future would hold.

389
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,000
But we knew there
was no turning back.

390
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,970
So...on the day we left... we
burned down the family home...

391
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:24,210
and all the familiar
things inside.

392
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,120
Because some memories...

393
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,260
aren't meant to leave traces.

394
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:35,700
With you always in my sight,
I can manage to draw breath

395
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:43,100
And for me, that ought to
be enough in itself, and yet...

396
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:51,000
All little old me ever does is
repeat the same old mistakes

397
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,460
How much strength
do I need to come by

398
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:58,430
before I can get by
without hurting anything?

399
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,960
I am not going to stray,
I'm going to trust this love,

400
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,770
and with it I will go on living!

401
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,330
I'm going to take these wounds,

402
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:11,020
the ones that will not close,
and squeeze them tight!

403
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:17,160
The two of us must
keep on walking,

404
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,250
since we can never return again

405
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:29,300
Even now, deep within my heart,

406
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,250
I still feel the pain
of this indelible sin

407
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,600
Darling

408
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:43,460
Full Metal Alchemist
Episode 4: A Forger's Love.

409
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,730
In a forest village
a man confronts

410
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:47,750
his foolishness... when
a doll comes to life.

411
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:52,070
But he'll repeat his same mistakes,
if alchemy can bring him love.
