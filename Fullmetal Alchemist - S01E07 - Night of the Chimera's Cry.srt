1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:08,494
You should take this with you.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,020
You know, I was picturing
a more poignant ceremony.

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,115
Trumpets or something.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,120
Sure, Edward.

5
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,820
Congrats, you're a
dog of the military now.

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,360
Lieutenant Havok, take him home.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,194
Yes, sir.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,080
Nina...

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,580
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,220
To obtain something of
equal value, must be lost.

11
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:45,640
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:53,140
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,280
Come on, Chief.

14
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,960
You look like the
sky is falling down.

15
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't let the
Lieutenant-Colonel get to you.

16
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,220
His mind's on a case now.

17
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,420
What case?

18
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,000
There's a serial killer around.

19
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,080
Only targets women.

20
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,860
Ugh... Sounds like
police business.

21
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:57,840
Why does he care?

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,160
It's the military's backyard.

23
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,140
It's dishonorable.

24
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,060
Mustang cares about that stuff.

25
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,088
Or wants a promotion.

26
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:08,840
It's true, kid.

27
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,720
Mustang's no political novice.

28
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,480
He'll do whatever he has to to
move up the chain around here.

29
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,420
But if that's all he was
about, we wouldn't follow him.

30
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,420
Tell me then, what
else is he about?

31
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,700
You'll learn soon enough.

32
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,770
Check it out.

33
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:36,330
Whoa, is that the real thing?

34
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,690
Hey, get that back,
you stupid mutt!

35
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:44,270
Does that thing have a big
tag on it that says Alexander?

36
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,890
Guess he's still Ed.

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,180
Your tenant's becoming a star.

38
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,460
Who would have thought that a 12-year-old
could actually pass the exam, right?

39
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,260
He is a prodigy.

40
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,760
Hopefully that's a blessing.

41
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,231
Alexander!

42
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,520
So, to honor Edward's groundbreaking
achievement, we're going to have a feast.

43
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,270
What do you say?

44
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:10,760
Hooray!

45
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you serious?

46
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,560
Mm-hmm.

47
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,580
Would you like to
join us, Lieutenant?

48
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,640
Sorry, full schedule.

49
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,820
Is that so?

50
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,540
Oh, Mr. Tucker.

51
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
The Lieutenant Colonel asked
me to pass a message along.

52
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,960
Your assessment
day is coming up.

53
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,900
He says he's
looking forward to it.

54
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,000
Yes, I'm sure that he is.

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,600
This assessment deal, is
that something the state does?

56
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,380
Mm-hmm.

57
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,720
If I don't submit meaningful findings for
my research each year, they'll revoke my

58
00:04:42,721 --> 00:04:44,760
certification as
a state alchemist.

59
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,000
Wow, that's a lot of pressure.

60
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,140
Last year, I didn't exactly
get a positive assessment.

61
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,400
So this year, it's do or die.

62
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,740
Let him have it, Daddy!

63
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,900
I know.

64
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,900
Why don't you make
another talking chimera?

65
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,080
Yeah, and we'll be
around to see it this time.

66
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,460
Well, that is what
everyone asks for.

67
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,480
I promise I'll let you
all see the result.

68
00:05:21,349 --> 00:05:22,409
OOO A letter.

69
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:23,662
Who are you writing to?

70
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,480
A person.

71
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,347
It doesn't matter.

72
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,240
Ohhhh, it's to Winry, isn't it?

73
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,120
Hey, it's just a simple report.

74
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,500
Just passed the alchemy exam.

75
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,350
How's the weather?

76
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,420
That whole thing, okay?

77
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,040
Winry's a pretty name.

78
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,060
Is she your girlfriend?

79
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,400
As a matter of fact...

80
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:41,720
She's not!

81
00:05:41,731 --> 00:05:42,080
She's not!

82
00:05:42,081 --> 00:05:42,550
She's not!

83
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,079
We're friends!

84
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:43,860
I know.

85
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,900
I'm gonna write a
letter to my mom, too.

86
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,640
So your mom lives far away.

87
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,640
Doesn't she, Nina?

88
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:56,840
That's right.

89
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,780
She told my dad he was a good-for-nothing
alchemist who couldn't do anything right,

90
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,280
and she went to
live with her parents.

91
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,160
Hopefully, she'll
send a reply this time.

92
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:27,153
Here.

93
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,180
My wife.

94
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:37,000
She just couldn't stand
being poor, and she left us.

95
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:40,820
As luck would have it, I joined the
state alchemist practically the next day.

96
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:42,005
Eh.

97
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,460
The state's been
good to me these years.

98
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,900
They've given me this
mansion, this entire lifestyle.

99
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:52,200
If I don't pass the assessment,
we'll go back to the way things were.

100
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,200
I sometimes doubt we could.

101
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,620
Daddy, you can
pass it just like Dad.

102
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,060
Heh heh heh.

103
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,470
You're barking.

104
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,410
I get it.

105
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,930
You want to go
for a walk, right?

106
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,770
Listen to me.

107
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,070
I don't want this simple stuff.

108
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,730
I need the info on the talking chimera
that Shao Tucker made two years ago.

109
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,530
Hey, Sheska.

110
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,010
Know anything about this?

111
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:39,110
Um, the Tucker
reports are restricted, sir.

112
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:39,985
You don't have access.

113
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,684
Well, would you
check on it, please?

114
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:43,570
I'm not some normal kid.

115
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:47,610
That watch is what got you in here, but
you need clearance from the Brigadier

116
00:07:47,611 --> 00:07:49,010
General to read those files.

117
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:52,290
Brigadier General, huh?

118
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,890
Surely you've heard of him?

119
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,470
The Ironblood Alchemist?

120
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,810
He's the authority on adapting
alchemy for military tactics.

121
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,110
If his name is attached, it
must be some military secret.

122
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,290
This is getting interesting.

123
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,850
I'm telling you,
you can't go in.

124
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,850
This branch is for
military use only.

125
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:12,590
Stop!

126
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,130
If you want access,
you've got to get a pass.

127
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,390
I was told this was the
only place to find out.

128
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:19,063
Stop!

129
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,790
What now?

130
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:22,810
Sorry.

131
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:24,750
Passed the test
like everyone else.

132
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,880
Hey, come back!

133
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,490
My brother.

134
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,330
What is this?

135
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,190
Why did you Mark me so?

136
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,970
This vile sign.

137
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,150
What do you want me to do?

138
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,590
Look, Elysia.

139
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:05,310
Your big brother Ed is here.

140
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,490
Honey, he's trying
to tell you something.

141
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,510
You're not listening.

142
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,430
Hello.

143
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,510
Take your time.

144
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,150
You know I don't
mind holding her.

145
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,870
Back to work.

146
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,150
You were asking about
Tucker's Chimera, right?

147
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:22,630
Yeah.

148
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,162
You being in the Investigations Department,
I thought you could tell me something.

149
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,270
You do live with the guy.

150
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,290
Why don't you ask him?

151
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,510
You know, he's so busy with
the coming assessment and all.

152
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,190
Hmm.

153
00:09:34,191 --> 00:09:36,070
I don't know too
much about him myself.

154
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,750
I know that Chimera he fashioned
got him into the alchemy program.

155
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,490
First one ever that could
speak the human language.

156
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,890
You're sure it was real?

157
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:44,750
Definitely.

158
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:45,930
But it only spoke once.

159
00:09:45,931 --> 00:09:47,310
It said, I want to die.

160
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,342
Apparently, it wouldn't
eat after that and died.

161
00:09:54,038 --> 00:09:57,231
It was in pain. But why would
he make such a misserable thing?

162
00:09:57,676 --> 00:09:58,384
Who knows?

163
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:01,450
But someone in the military
thought it had some sort of relevance.

164
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,210
How do you think
he got that mansion?

165
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,050
And what happened
to Tucker's wife?

166
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:07,650
What do you mean?

167
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,550
She died before he
arrived here in Central.

168
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,530
Is that wrong?

169
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,330
Yeah.

170
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:18,090
Go ahead.

171
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,550
Serial kill?

172
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,170
You sure?

173
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:21,770
Oh, hell!

174
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:30,620
Mom!

175
00:10:34,512 --> 00:10:36,052
That makes five.

176
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,620
Hasn't investigations
found anything yet?

177
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,040
Don't blame us.

178
00:10:45,498 --> 00:10:46,021
Mom......my

179
00:10:46,373 --> 00:10:46,903
Mom

180
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:48,650
Noooo!

181
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:11,460
Sounds like you saw
something pretty awful, huh?

182
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,820
It's no big deal.

183
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,080
You were crying out for your mother
the whole time you were asleep.

184
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,680
And you kept saying
you were sorry.

185
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,360
I've had my suspicions about
you two ever since I saw your body.

186
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:27,720
Now I'm sure.

187
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:44,370
What you boys did,
it's strictly forbidden.

188
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,270
But I can understand.

189
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,050
Science is a powerful
thing, capable of so much.

190
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:54,030
If you can, it's
difficult not to try.

191
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:54,710
Who are you?

192
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,750
What do you want?

193
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,570
I don't know what Roy Mustang's
been filling your head with.

194
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:07,970
But the research of Shao Tucker falls
under the jurisdiction of me, Basque Gran.

195
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,390
The Brigadier General.

196
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,690
So that's you.

197
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:15,710
The Sewing Life Alchemist is one
of my top priorities, and I know
you've been snooping around.

198
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:19,610
I can no longer permit you
two to take shelter at his estate.

199
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,760
Where are you
going, big brothers?

200
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,720
Are you coming back?

201
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,620
Don't worry.

202
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,900
We'll come play with
you again real soon.

203
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:31,440
Really?

204
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,660
Mm-hmm.

205
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:35,385
Yeah.

206
00:12:37,828 --> 00:12:38,528
Don't forget!

207
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,200
Don't they just eat at you?

208
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:46,900
I hear when that kid showed off his
transmutation abilities without the use of

209
00:12:46,901 --> 00:12:50,760
a circle, the King actually opened
up his mouth and complimented him.

210
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,100
Now that upstart Mustang's
getting points for discovering him.

211
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,000
My points, Tucker!

212
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:57,640
I'm sorry if they caused
trouble for you, sir.

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,160
I smoothed things
over for you last year.

214
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:03,396
When you turned in a pile of
trash and called it a research.

215
00:13:03,465 --> 00:13:06,080
Fail it again and I'll get
the heat for endorsing you.

216
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,960
But, General... What, Tucker?

217
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,220
Would you rather the
alternative approach?

218
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,600
You want to pass the title of
Sewing Life Alchemist to that boy
and go back to your old life?

219
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,620
Drifting the streets of some backward
town with ideas and an empty stomach?

220
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,420
Your assessment's in two days.

221
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,420
It's time to show or roll over.

222
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,814
Daddy.

223
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,030
Are you hiding somewhere?

224
00:13:48,732 --> 00:13:51,790
I'm at the end of the
line here, Nina.

225
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,038
Daddy.

226
00:14:13,311 --> 00:14:14,570
Really think this
is a good idea?

227
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,270
What if you lose your
certification for this?

228
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:21,270
If that's what it takes to prove
me wrong tonight, then so be it.

229
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:35,733
Over here.

230
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:42,233
Come on in, boys.

231
00:14:54,966 --> 00:14:56,726
I told you I'd let you see.

232
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,960
It's a perfect version.

233
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,480
A chimera that knows
the human tongue.

234
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
Listen, dear.

235
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,560
That's your friend Edward.

236
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,300
Look.

237
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,229
Edward....
friend?

238
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,960
Yes, exactly.

239
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,240
That's very good.

240
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,870
That's very good.

241
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:17,722
Unbelievable!

242
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,220
It really can talk!

243
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,480
I'll have no problem
getting the funding now.

244
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,960
I can't believe I didn't see it.

245
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,790
The other one it was too old to adapt.

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,260
Edward, my friend?

247
00:15:49,168 --> 00:15:49,537
Yeah.

248
00:15:49,955 --> 00:15:50,601
That's right.

249
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,660
Edward, why does it hurt here?

250
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,083
Brother?

251
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,660
So, Tucker.

252
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,800
Something wrong?

253
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:06,760
When was the first time you made
one of these human-speaking chimeras?

254
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,220
I thought I told you.

255
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,000
It's been two years now.

256
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:14,700
And when exactly did
your wife leave you?

257
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,180
Two years ago.

258
00:16:16,298 --> 00:16:16,573
Why?

259
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,980
And those letters
that Nina wrote.

260
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,620
Did any of them ever reach her?

261
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,020
What are you getting at?

262
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:24,740
Tell me this.

263
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,282
Where have Alexander
and Nina gone to?

264
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:34,020
I hate prodigies like you, Ed.

265
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,280
Too damn perceptive.

266
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,560
Brother!

267
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,760
This guy used his own wife, Al!

268
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,020
And this time?

269
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,240
His daughter!

270
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,000
And his dog.

271
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,380
He transmuted
them into that thing.

272
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,280
An easy process when
you use people, right?

273
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,420
Why are you getting
so upset, Edward?

274
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,820
It's the nature of
scientific progress.

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,820
Animal testing,
experimentation, trial and error.

276
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,040
All advancements have a price.

277
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,480
Shut up!

278
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,600
I'm not gonna let you
rationalize this, you monster.

279
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,000
That was your
own family, dammit!

280
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,700
You've been toying
with people's lives!

281
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,200
Toying with lives?

282
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,420
What?

283
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,160
Like your arm and leg there?

284
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,960
Or your brother's body?

285
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,460
Or trying to bring
your mother back?

286
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,220
That's toying, isn't it?

287
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,840
You don't really think you're
any different from me, do you, Ed?

288
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,340
Why, Mr. Tucker?

289
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,980
The whole point was to pass the
assessment and continue your way of life.

290
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,840
But now your family's gone.

291
00:17:36,841 --> 00:17:38,400
What life is left?

292
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,560
That's the funny thing.

293
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,640
I didn't have a reason.

294
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,240
I fully understood no matter
what I did, my life would be ruined.

295
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,900
I could either do it with
the science or without.

296
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,780
And so I chose
science to see if I could.

297
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,940
What kind of man... When you have the
power to do something, it's hard not to try.

298
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,900
Isn't that what
we agreed on, Ed?

299
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,460
Aren't we so much alike?

300
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:00,940
No!

301
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:02,900
Sure.

302
00:18:02,901 --> 00:18:05,260
Part of me did it for
respect and this house.

303
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,510
Just as you partly did
it for for your mother.

304
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,360
But there's more.

305
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,920
You're desperate to
put your mind to use, Ed.

306
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,620
To see what you're capable of.

307
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,200
To put the world
under your fingers.

308
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,980
That's the essence of alchemy.

309
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,320
You did it for knowledge.

310
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,100
Control.

311
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,760
Above all, you did it
just to prove you can.

312
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,620
You're wrong.

313
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,020
Alchemy isn't meant to be.

314
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:31,804
I'm not like you!

315
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,000
I'm not!

316
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,600
Not!

317
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm not!

318
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,120
Brother, you'll kill him!

319
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,928
No, big brother.

320
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,010
Nina, I want you to
bear with me, okay?

321
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:58,490
This may hurt.

322
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,170
What are you doing?

323
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,330
You're not planning to
split them up, are you?

324
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,530
You don't know how!

325
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:09,630
If the chimeras of perfect transmutation fuse to
the core, there's no way to separate them now.

326
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,270
Careful.

327
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:13,120
You'll just do to them
what you did to your mother.

328
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,800
You promised you'd
come play with me.

329
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,380
I know.

330
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Assaulting army personnel?

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,200
What the hell's going on?

332
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,500
Spare me, sir.

333
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,840
He used his own daughter.

334
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,710
Mr. Tucker will face a court martial
and will take the chimera with us.

335
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,570
Naturally, you're to tell no
one what you saw tonight.

336
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,170
WHAT‽

337
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:47,210
You want to cover
it up, don't you?

338
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,110
You knew about this!

339
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,210
You want to make
some half-beast ar..

340
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:58,430
Let's go.

341
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,390
Yes, sir.

342
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,960
Damn it.

343
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,080
I'm not going to let them
turn her into a test subject.

344
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:20,130
Nina!

345
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:26,090
Brother!

346
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,480
Your makeup.

347
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,640
Yes, you're made up of one
part human and one part beast.

348
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:56,500
But I don't understand, brother.

349
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,620
How do I know that?

350
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,280
You poor thing.

351
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:06,360
You're a sin against nature
and your body is in so much pain.

352
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,409
Oh merciful God who shapes us all, please
return these scarred souls to your unending ruin.

353
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,180
You see her?

354
00:21:43,164 --> 00:21:45,250
God I understand now.

355
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:48,690
The reason my brother
gave me this cursed arm.

356
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,490
So that I could find the alchemists
who have fallen from your path.

357
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:56,550
And with their own
demon arts, destroy them.

358
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:02,670
It's like an alchemist
deconstructed her.

359
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,090
But who?

360
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,690
I guess it doesn't matter.

361
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:10,650
Even if we did find them,
it wouldn't bring her back.

362
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,930
I'm sorry, Nina.

363
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:17,390
Brother, don't...

364
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,410
Full Metal Alchemist!

365
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,516
Episode 8, The
Philosopher's Stone.

366
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:44,850
Brother is tormented.

367
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:46,790
We're only a couple of children.

368
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,190
There's nothing we
can do about the killings.

369
00:23:49,690 --> 00:23:51,961
At least... that's
what we thought.
