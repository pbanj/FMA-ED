1
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,550
It's beautiful here
and so peaceful.

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,870
Yeah, it's rural, a nice way of
saying there's nothing going on.

3
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,090
Four years, brother.

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,180
Has it really been that long?

5
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,476
Hmm?

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,530
You mean you haven't come
home once since you left?

7
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,570
You can't really come home to a place
where there's no family waiting for you.

8
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,950
You know our general
situation, don't you, Major?

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,610
Yes, I do.

10
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,050
Well, this sure is a surprise.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,130
Winry! Better get out here!

12
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,430
Honored guests!

13
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,430
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

14
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,110
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

15
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:18,570
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:26,030
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,030
Well hello to you too, Den.

18
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,890
Old Lady Pinako.

19
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,530
It's been a long time.

20
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,410
I need some more
of your handiwork.

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,096
Apparently so.

22
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,196
You really have done a
number this time, huh?

23
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,710
I don't know why you have so
much trouble keeping your arms.

24
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,056
Yeah, well, I've had a
lot of things to swing at.

25
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,376
Huh.

26
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,350
Yet it seems like
you've gotten smaller.

27
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,436
Who are you calling small,
you miniature-sized hag?

28
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,400
You're shorter than your temple!

29
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,996
You're so short,
you're two-dimensional!

30
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:32,936
Micro moron!

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,736
Grandma, please!

32
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,890
Edward Elric.

33
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,830
How dare you speak to your
elder with such blatant disrespect?

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,630
Let me remedy this fight
with my genteel decorum!

35
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,776
Who the heck is this guy?

36
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,830
He really doesn't
get the joke, does he?

37
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,230
Alex Louisa Armstrong,
humbly at your service.

38
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,010
Flattered. I'm Pinako Rockbell.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,130
Brother!

40
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,456
Great! I buy you a wrench
and you try to kill me with it!

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,296
Well, apparently you're
trying to kill yourself!

42
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,450
What have you been up to?

43
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,656
Gone!

44
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,836
I'm serious, Ed!

45
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:14,540
I want answers!

46
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,950
How did you wreck the
best Auto-mail I've ever made?

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,870
I put my heart and soul into that!

48
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,476
Is it really my fault, though?

49
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,990
It fell apart so easily.

50
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,496
Al's armor is all busted up, too,
and steel doesn't shatter on its own.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,410
You've been getting
into some real trouble.

52
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,150
Uh, no. I mean, ask Ed.

53
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,276
Guess I was wrong, Pipsqueak.

54
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,596
You actually have gotten
taller, at least by a inch.

55
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,170
Then don't say Pipsqueak!

56
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,490
You're off balance.

57
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,276
We'll need to make some height
adjustments to your leg while you're here.

58
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,050
and of course, the new arm will
have to be built from scratch.

59
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,536
Listen, I know I'm asking a lot,
but can you finish it all in a week?

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,970
We don't have much time.

61
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:52,906
Don't insult me, Ed.

62
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,380
We'll have it
done in three days.

63
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,620
You're the best there is, Grams.

64
00:04:57,090 --> 00:04:58,386
But you just got in town.

65
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:00,140
What do you have
to do that's so urgent?

66
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,940
We... we just want to get to
Central as soon as possible.

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,940
We're looking for
something, that's all.

68
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,500
It wouldn't be something
dangerous, would it?

69
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,086
No!

70
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,450
It's nothing like that at all!

71
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,600
Just some research!

72
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:16,950
Right.

73
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:18,520
You're nothing but trouble.

74
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:25,020
We drive her crazy sometimes,
but she's always there for us, right?

75
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:26,840
Yeah.

76
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,220
She is.

77
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,140
Ah, yeah.

78
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,261
I know it's a spare, but there's just something
about the way the old lady makes them.

79
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,840
It's weird being back.

80
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,086
Kinda nice.

81
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:43,010
Nothing's really
changed here, has it?

82
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,480
Not at all.

83
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,110
Mr. Armstrong, was it?

84
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,150
I was hoping you could tell me
something about the daily life of those boys.

85
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:02,750
Living as far out in the country as we do, it's
seldom we get to hear any news from the cities.

86
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,430
and those boys haven't mailed me so much
as a postcard since they've been gone.

87
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,630
I worry about them, that's all.

88
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,130
I can only offer you this.

89
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,400
The Elric brothers, especially
Edward, have garnered

90
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:20,330
quite a reputation around
Central and in the East.

91
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:25,451
As the unfortunate result, they do get pulled
into a wide range of troubles from time to time.

92
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,690
But it's all right.

93
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,370
We take my word for it.

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,210
Those boys are strong.

95
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:32,460
Strong?

96
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:33,591
Really?

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,490
Please, help them.

98
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,070
Just bear with us, Ed.

99
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,530
This pains nothing.

100
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,526
I still feel like we're
wasting too much time here.

101
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,100
We've got to get back to
Central and find Marco's work.

102
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:52,846
and we will.

103
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,400
But don't you think you
should relax while you can?

104
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,560
Things probably aren't going
to be easy when we get there.

105
00:06:58,750 --> 00:06:59,920
I know I should.

106
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,746
But I can't stand lying
around doing nothing.

107
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,106
I get all fidgety.

108
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,680
Brother, I've been thinking.

109
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,560
Maybe you should visit Mom.

110
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,640
You mean go to her grave?

111
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,566
They said the Auto-mail
would be ready in three days.

112
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,640
and you've got nothing
else to do until then.

113
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:20,260
Go see her.

114
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,640
I'll wait here.

115
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,860
You're right.

116
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,800
I'll be back in
a while, I guess.

117
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,220
I saw that your firewood
was a little low, Mrs. Rockbell.

118
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:39,046
Thank you.

119
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,946
That's nice.

120
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,820
But you know, you're free to relax
too while you're staying with us.

121
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:44,390
I appreciate that, ma'am.

122
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:47,420
But no, daily training
is essential for a soldier.

123
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,370
and do you know where Edward is?

124
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,781
I haven't seen him for a while,
and that makes me nervous.

125
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:54,360
He said he was going to visit
his mother's grave, I believe.

126
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,086
Hmm.

127
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:57,626
I told him it was dangerous
to venture out on his own.

128
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,220
He needs to stop
taking these risks.

129
00:07:59,290 --> 00:07:59,726
Don't worry.

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,766
He's not alone.

131
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:03,460
He's got the best escort
in Risembool with him.

132
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,190
Ha!

133
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:11,026
Edward Elric!

134
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:12,180
Is that actually you?

135
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:12,766
Yeah.

136
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,920
It's been a while, huh?

137
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,126
I'll say four or
five years, right?

138
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:17,786
Yet you're just as puny as ever.

139
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:17,950
Hey!

140
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:19,081
Don't call me puny!

141
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,846
Don't mind him.

142
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,360
So are you still one of those
state whatever they're called?

143
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,146
I sure am.

144
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,166
Well, you be careful.

145
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,326
That must be a dangerous
job, you being puny and all.

146
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,840
Would you stop calling me puny!

147
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:38,000
Hey, you okay?

148
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,760
You're just staring into space.

149
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,880
Uh, Winry.

150
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:44,660
That girl over
there, who is she?

151
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,106
Oh, that's Mellie.

152
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,260
You know her.

153
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,800
Come on, you remember.

154
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,590
We played together
all the time as kids.

155
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,620
Hide-and-go-seek and tag,
exploring the river and stuff.

156
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,506
Oh.

157
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,060
Is something wrong, Al?

158
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,250
No.

159
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:05,660
I just couldn't
remember who she was.

160
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:06,686
That's all.

161
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:08,060
My mind was blank.

162
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,660
That's no big deal.

163
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,446
It's been years and
she's changed a lot.

164
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:12,800
You just didn't recognize her.

165
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,906
Yeah.

166
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,060
Maybe.

167
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,600
How are we gonna
live without her?

168
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,700
We're not Al.

169
00:09:32,224 --> 00:09:34,124
We're gonna bring her back.

170
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,610
Ready to go home, Den?

171
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,650
Is that the watch they give you?

172
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,496
Hm? Yeah.

173
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,640
It's got amplifiers.

174
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,130
That boost your transmutation.

175
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,290
Can I see?

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,930
The loving workmanship.

177
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,936
The detail.

178
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,676
Now, this is the
work of a craftsman.

179
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,316
How's it run?

180
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,716
Do you wind it or
is it self-wound?

181
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,276
Or could it possibly
be a new technique?

182
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,776
I don't know.

183
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,850
and as long as it's
functioning, I don't care.

184
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,630
Can I see how it
works, Ed, please?

185
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:14,556
Are you crazy?

186
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,796
I know how you get when you
have your hands on mechanics.

187
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,510
You'll take it apart
to the last screw.

188
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,136
So what if I do?

189
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,696
I'll put it back together
and it'll work just fine.

190
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,836
You know I'm the greatest
mechanic on the planet, Ed, right?

191
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,990
Get somebody else's.

192
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,850
Hm?

193
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:34,236
I think I'll go chop about
a year's worth of firewood.

194
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,390
Yes.

195
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,390
Wow you guys are
stingy, aren't you?

196
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,020
Al, I talked to Pinako.

197
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,980
She said my arm's
gonna be ready tomorrow.

198
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,046
and I'll fix you.

199
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,086
First thing I do.

200
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,800
Things are finally looking up.

201
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:55,380
That's good.

202
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,320
Brother, did I
ever have friends?

203
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,446
What?

204
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,180
That's an
out-of-the-blue question.

205
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,526
I don't remember any of them.

206
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,606
I tried to.

207
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:09,806
But it's hazy.

208
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,160
They don't have faces.

209
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,706
You know how memories work.

210
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,146
You've had a lot of new
experiences and they just pile up.

211
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:18,460
It's natural for old
memories to fade a little.

212
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,800
There's something wrong with me.

213
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,770
So listen, Al.

214
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,490
There's this thing, see?

215
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,430
It's something I've been meaning
to tell you for a long time now.

216
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:46,310
But I've been kind of scared, I
guess, of what your reaction would be.

217
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:48,110
What?

218
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,116
Damn it.

219
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,171
It's just... Tell me.

220
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:56,830
No, it's nothing.

221
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,776
Forget it.

222
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,930
Brother, tell me!

223
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,010
Gentlemen, look up at the sky!

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:06,896
This night gives us a bounty of gifts, like
a blanket of shimmering, brilliant jewels.

225
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,790
It's a majesty that cannot be witnessed
in the city in its haze of electric light.

226
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,270
This is an amazing place you're
from, this quiet little village of Risembool.

227
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,530
In exchange for its barrenness,
it has much the city does not.

228
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,510
You can lose
yourself in the sky.

229
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:31,471
Years ago, we used to look up at the
stars almost every night, didn't we, Al?

230
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,410
Yeah.

231
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,710
and dream.

232
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,430
and now, the moment
you've been waiting for!

233
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,650
Docking time!

234
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,090
Yeah, right.

235
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,016
Connecting to each of my nerves.

236
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,350
I can't get enough.

237
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,070
Don't complain, you baby.

238
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,316
You want to hurry and get
back to Central, don't you?

239
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,536
You got that part right.

240
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,930
This is just more motivation.

241
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,990
I can't wait till I get my body
back to pure-grade flesh and bone.

242
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,156
Well, that's going to be a
real disappointment for us.

243
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,470
We make a killing off you.

244
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:01,650
Seriously, Ed, why go to all
this trouble just for human limbs?

245
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:06,050
You've got the smell of oil, the creak of
synthetic muscles, the hum of spinning bearings.

246
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,550
Who needs natural
when you've got Auto-mail?

247
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,470
Loser machine junkie.

248
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,950
Alchemy freak!

249
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,476
Okay, we're ready.

250
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,750
One, two, three!

251
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,736
You two get up.

252
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,476
We're going to lay
him down right there.

253
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,930
We could use some help.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,230
I had no idea attaching
Auto-mail was so painful.

255
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,630
I've seen it make the most hardened
war heroes scream like children.

256
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,710
It's no small matter.

257
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:47,016
Well, what do you think about
the changed designs, Ed?

258
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,230
I tried to make the steel 80%
lighter than the last go-around.

259
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,830
After all, we can't have it weighing you
down so much you never grow any taller.

260
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,790
That's got to be illegal.

261
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:00,010
Making fun of somebody's
height when they're in pain like this.

262
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,936
Look at you.

263
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,950
You've already got
enough energy to argue.

264
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,230
You'll be fine.

265
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,956
Seriously, now.

266
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,108
The lighter weight should
make you faster, but that

267
00:14:08,132 --> 00:14:10,600
means it's easier to break,
too, so don't be reckless.

268
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,890
You can replace Auto-mail,
but you've only got one life.

269
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,150
Right.

270
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,790
That's the first all-nighter
I've pulled in a while.

271
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,990
I'm beat.

272
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,270
Really, Winry.

273
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,236
Thanks.

274
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,890
Don't thank me for the rush.

275
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,390
I'm charging you a fortune.

276
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,550
How do I look?

277
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,660
How do you feel?

278
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:32,791
That's the question.

279
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,616
Great!

280
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,676
100%!

281
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,056
I'm glad to hear it.

282
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,076
Yeah, I bet you are.

283
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,710
It means now we
can take care of you.

284
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,650
So you're sure
this is everything?

285
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:42,716
Mm-hmm.

286
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,250
The Major and the rest were very
careful to pick up every piece of me.

287
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,376
Will he be able to
move once he's fixed?

288
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,810
Yeah, well, you definitely
have to know what you're doing.

289
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,790
See that seal in there?

290
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,216
Mm-hmm.

291
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,510
That's the anchoring point.

292
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:59,350
It's the intermediary
between Al's soul and the armor.

293
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,810
It really was a
close call, wasn't it?

294
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,516
If that gash had been
a little closer in... Right.

295
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,000
So no matter what else happens,
we've got to guard that better.

296
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:11,310
Without that critical area, Al,
there'd be nothing to tie you down.

297
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,630
It looks like it was
drawn with blood.

298
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,050
Yeah, that's my blood.

299
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,330
I was kind of in a hurry.

300
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,536
Hmm.

301
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,690
Oh, inspiring!

302
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,016
Such a bond!

303
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,756
Such a display
of brotherly love!

304
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,090
Back up, Major Spaz.

305
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,210
You're really getting in
the way of the work here.

306
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:27,550
Here goes.

307
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,600
I feel great.

308
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:48,220
Thanks, brother.

309
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,626
Aw don't mention it.

310
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:51,340
Should we do our usual routine now?

311
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,080
What does that mean?

312
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,046
Nothing.

313
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,000
Just a little skirmish
between brothers.

314
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,846
Our teacher told us a long time ago you
have to train the body to train the mind.

315
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,300
So we spar once in a
while to test our skills.

316
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,140
But I gotta say, in all these years,
I've never beaten this tin can once.

317
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,226
Is that so?

318
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,660
Then allow me to help
you in your goal, Edward!

319
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,550
We're okay, but thanks.

320
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,700
Thank you!

321
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:20,360
I hope you're
ready for this, Al.

322
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:38,641
Hey, now boys, don't get carried
away and break yourselves again!

323
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,240
Good grief.

324
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:44,180
Talk about your one-track minds.

325
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,760
There's still a
couple of children.

326
00:16:54,670 --> 00:16:56,160
Next up, me!

327
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,740
Agh!

328
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,666
Uuh.

329
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,820
Huh.

330
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,866
It would be a crime against Discovery
not to find out how this thing ticks.

331
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,180
The polished form, the
curious workmanship.

332
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:06,940
It's clearly the
work of a master.

333
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,100
Custom jobs are so great.

334
00:17:09,210 --> 00:17:10,740
I bet it's even better inside.

335
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:12,140
I want to take it apart.

336
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,620
Oh, please I want to
put it back together again!

337
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,280
Edward...

338
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,220
You better watch it!

339
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,566
You're strong, but
your attitude's soft.

340
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,980
You'll never win like this!

341
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:31,260
Ugh!

342
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,426
Brother.

343
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,580
Damn.

344
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,410
Forget what?

345
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,666
What's the matter, Erich?

346
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,820
Is that all you've got?

347
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,556
Alright!

348
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,710
Yeah!

349
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:11,734
I can't believe it.

350
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:13,696
We did it! We did it! We got him!

351
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,496
We really got him.

352
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,030
Good job, brother!

353
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,054
Yeah!

354
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,930
Winry?

355
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:37,830
Is there something wrong?

356
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,850
I'm sorry, Ed.

357
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,750
I'm sorry.

358
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,670
Ah!

359
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,716
You've got some nerve!

360
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,076
I know.

361
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,450
I didn't mean to see.

362
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,676
Ah, hell.

363
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,576
No one's seen that dumb thing.

364
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,396
Not even Al.

365
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,550
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,060
I'm one tough
survivor, aren't I?

367
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:10,350
Having to carry around my
guilty motivation in my pocket.

368
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,360
Like some sniveling little
kid with a magic charm.

369
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,100
Edward... We've got
no home, no family.

370
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:18,900
The only thing that makes
sense is moving forward.

371
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:21,780
But I'm still wasting all
this time here looking back.

372
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,810
What's wasted?

373
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,220
How can you say that?

374
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:26,586
What about Grandma and me?

375
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,406
We're a home that's
always been here.

376
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,560
Why do you want to keep
shutting everything out?

377
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,820
Don't be dramatic.

378
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,300
What the hell are you
getting teary about anyway?

379
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,630
Because you won't.

380
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:39,626
Neither of you will
after all this time.

381
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,980
So I'm crying for you both.

382
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,170
Where could they have gone?

383
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,610
Didn't you tell them that
we were having dinner?

384
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,936
You needn't worry
about them, Winry.

385
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,196
I'm sure they'll
be along shortly.

386
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:00,290
We just have to wait for them
to return like we always have.

387
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:10,510
This is where
the front door was.

388
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,070
and the living room.

389
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,070
The fireplace was here.

390
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,990
We'd start it when it got cold.

391
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,750
You'd always find an excuse so you
wouldn't have to chop wood yourself.

392
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:34,560
Whenever we stayed out too late, Mom
would flash a lamp from the second story window.

393
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:38,520
It was bright and it cut through
the darkness all across the hills.

394
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:42,660
and no matter where we were, we
could see it and we'd come running home.

395
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:46,220
Yeah, I forgot about that.

396
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,050
You boys are fools.

397
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,390
You do have a home with a
caring family waiting for you.

398
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,630
Brother.

399
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,970
Look.

400
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,650
Now you boys don't be strangers.

401
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,556
You come by and have dinner
with us sometime soon.

402
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,316
You hear?

403
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,176
We will.

404
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,610
Home sweet home, right?

405
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,390
Thank you, Granny.

406
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,780
Yes, your hospitality
has been immeasurable.

407
00:21:51,781 --> 00:21:53,790
So you'll come home soon?

408
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,650
Yeah.

409
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,396
Granny.

410
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:03,550
Huh?

411
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,950
I read the inside of Ed's watch.

412
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,010
He engraved something on it.

413
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,930
Don't forget.

414
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,350
On the date they
burned their house and left.

415
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,470
But what exactly do you
think you wanted to remember?

416
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:40,106
Full Metal Alchemist.

417
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,740
Episode 18, Marco's Notes.

418
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,060
The first branch of
the library in Central.

419
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,280
From a pile of burnt ashes,
a stunning truth will emerge.
