1
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:06,570
You really don't
know who this is?

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,950
Trust me, if we were going to send
someone here with you, it wouldn't be a kid.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,710
I would have just come to look
after you myself, like last time.

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:13,830
Look after us?

5
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,030
You tried to kill us!

6
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:16,450
I was just doing my job.

7
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,947
Izumi told me to
toughen you up a little bit.

8
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,510
Nearly dying of starvation and getting her
asses beat was supposed to toughen us up?

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,924
How would you do that to kids?

10
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:25,190
What kind of monster are you?

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:28,430
Stop bitching about the past and think
about someone other than yourselves!

12
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,510
Yes, ma'am!

13
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:32,490
Teacher?

14
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:33,930
He's just a kid.

15
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,710
He probably climbed in someone's
boat and drifted here on accident.

16
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,650
I'm sure his parents
are looking for him.

17
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:39,730
I'll find out.

18
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:42,690
Teacher!

19
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:48,550
Brother!

20
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:49,210
That light!

21
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,090
That kid's an alchemist!

22
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:51,670
Ed, wait!

23
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,070
Listen, you!

24
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,550
You turned your
own fist into stone?

25
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:02,330
How the hell...

26
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:02,952
Please stop!

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,910
What just happened?

28
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:15,930
His clothes!

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,710
What are you doing?

30
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:22,110
He's just a kid.

31
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:23,510
He's an alchemist!

32
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,110
What if somebody sent
him here to spy on us?

33
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,390
Spy on you?

34
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,210
Don't you think you're
being a little bit paranoid, Ed?

35
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:32,810
I'm just being careful.

36
00:01:34,190 --> 00:01:35,730
Where are your
parents, little one?

37
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,010
How did you get out here?

38
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,710
Don't know.

39
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:39,870
What's your name?

40
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,730
I don't know.

41
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,170
Can't remember.

42
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:44,730
I don't know!

43
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,490
Hey, now.

44
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,490
No more crying.

45
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,290
I've got you, little one.

46
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:10,770
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

47
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,450
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

48
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:17,890
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

49
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,410
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

50
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:19,758
You've had enough.
You're be get sick.

51
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:27,602
I'm glad you two are back.
I was getting worried about you.

52
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,501
Hey we don't die that easy.

53
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:30,563
How's Izumi?

54
00:04:30,587 --> 00:04:32,387
Has the teacher
forgiven her students?

55
00:04:34,129 --> 00:04:36,595
We went against her teachings, Winry.

56
00:04:39,017 --> 00:04:42,793
She taught us, that we were just a small part of the world.

57
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,950
There's a cycle to the whole thing.

58
00:04:45,174 --> 00:04:45,974
A flow.

59
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:50,098
But we were conceded, we thought we
could bend the world anyway we wanted.

60
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:52,722
We were young, but that's no excuse.

61
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:53,846
We let her down.

62
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,870
Yeah.

63
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,894
I don't think she'll ever
completely forgive us.

64
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,575
Come on.

65
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,600
Your-You're too strong!

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:02,540
You got me!

67
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,160
Let me go!

68
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,360
Come on, you little monsters!

69
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,040
Have mercy!

70
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,130
That's not fair!

71
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,550
Everybody makes mistakes!

72
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,586
Doesn't she know that?

73
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,210
I'm going to tell her
what I think about...

74
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:19,946
No, you can't do that!

75
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:22,030
Just wait a minute!

76
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,090
Al was kidding!

77
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,470
I'm sure she'll forgive us!

78
00:05:25,075 --> 00:05:26,190
Yeah, she just worries about us.

79
00:05:26,191 --> 00:05:26,650
That's all.

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,040
We know she loves us, Winry.

81
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,740
So... 
what are you going to do about the boy?

82
00:05:41,141 --> 00:05:42,125
Uh..

83
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,120
I'm not sure.

84
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,340
Why does he bother you?

85
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,140
I don't know.

86
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,820
I guess I just think Teacher
trusts him too much, too easily.

87
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,720
In any case, he'll be staying with her
for a while until the police find his parents.

88
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,840
I think he's just
a lost little boy.

89
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,160
I hope you're right, Winry.

90
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,190
This meat is too tough!

91
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,856
Maybe we shouldn't
be doing this.

92
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,280
She locked it with alchemy.

93
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,978
If we open it, she'll know!

94
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,700
That is true.

95
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,600
You just put this back
exactly the way it was!

96
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,040
Why me!?

97
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,640
You wanna play?

98
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,040
Everyone's dead, so I got bored.

99
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,315
Did you come to play with me?

100
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,800
They're not dead.

101
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,020
They're just asleep.

102
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,640
I know what we should play!

103
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,580
This game!

104
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,680
See, I've won!

105
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,225
I watched you play
this game before!

106
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,280
So it was you.

107
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,480
You were watching
us on the island.

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
But why?

109
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,400
Where'd you come from, kid?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Stop.

111
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,520
You're hurting it.

112
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,000
Let go!

113
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:22,680
Play with me!

114
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,660
An animal isn't a toy
for you to play with, kid.

115
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,202
I'm playing!

116
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:26,660
I'm playing!

117
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:27,400
Hey, keep it down!

118
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,500
You're gonna wake
them all up, you idiot!

119
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,280
I'm playing!

120
00:07:30,281 --> 00:07:30,420
I'm playing!

121
00:07:30,421 --> 00:07:30,620
Okay?

122
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,180
Fine!

123
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,300
Look!
Look!

124
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,770
You can do that, too.

125
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:42,870
Can't you?

126
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,310
Don't lie to me.

127
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,066
Earlier on the island, you transmuted
a rock onto your hand.

128
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,046
And your clothes were
transmuted, too, weren't they?

129
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:50,850
Calm down, brother.

130
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:51,850
You're scaring him.

131
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:53,770
Al, you saw what
he did, didn't you?

132
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:55,610
Alchemy without a circle.

133
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,480
The only people who can
do that are me and Teacher.

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,086
And then she acted like she
didn't even notice he did it.

135
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,350
I call that strange.

136
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,930
What's the matter?

137
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,290
Just use alchemy.

138
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:09,890
Untie it!

139
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:10,630
Untie it!

140
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:14,550
Brother, I really don't think this boy
has anything to do with the others.

141
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:17,090
Al, I've seen his face
somewhere before.

142
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,130
I know I have.

143
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,201
I just need to figure out where.

144
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,690
Ed what did you do?

145
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:37,890
I didn't do anything.

146
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,550
I couldn't transmute a body and
a bed together even if I wanted to.

147
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,210
How am I supposed to
sleep with all this noise?

148
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,220
Hey.

149
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,480
Hold on, Teacher.

150
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,480
We didn't do anything.

151
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,220
It's true.

152
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,200
I know Ed lies sometimes,
but he's not lying about this.

153
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,040
I promise.

154
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,060
Thanks, Al.

155
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,020
You're a big help.

156
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:06,680
I know that.

157
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:10,156
No alchemist I trained would
transmute something so unrefined.

158
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:13,417
Not even mixing animals
into chimeras is this crass.

159
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,620
Let me go!

160
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,820
Let me down!

161
00:09:17,121 --> 00:09:18,121
Stop crying!

162
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,800
It's all right.

163
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,860
Now can you remember
what your original form was?

164
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,760
That's all you have to do.

165
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,760
Just remember what you were.

166
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,240
It's okay.

167
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,980
Just take your time.

168
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,170
Now explain yourselves!

169
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,610
What were you trying to accomplish
by frightening this poor child?

170
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,748
Please forgive us, Teacher.

171
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,190
I'm sorry to say, Teacher, but
I don't think that boy is human.

172
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,750
I think he's one of those
creatures who've been hunting us.

173
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:04,130
Just who or what is hunting you?

174
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:07,890
Who knows?

175
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,210
They say they're homunculi.

176
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,340
Thank you for always
coming by like this.

177
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,840
But are you sure it's okay
considering your new job?

178
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,520
Yeah, don't worry
about it, really.

179
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,560
I work at home, so I
make my own hours.

180
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:40,540
Oh, Sheska, I don't know if you're still investigating
the incident with Maes, but please be careful.

181
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,120
Oh, don't worry about me.

182
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,980
I'm not a very brave person.

183
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:48,040
I wouldn't get involved in something
I thought was terribly dangerous.

184
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,580
Bye-bye!

185
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,380
Bye-bye!

186
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,800
Good night, Sheska.

187
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,720
See you tomorrow!

188
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,380
Huh?

189
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:56,260
Ah!

190
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,326
Just a minute colonel.

191
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:01,830
Ah!

192
00:11:01,854 --> 00:11:02,554
Pfftbffft.

193
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,176
Ouch.

194
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:04,960
That hurt.

195
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,860
What are you doing
skulking around here?

196
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,480
Is it wrong of me to drive by and
check on the wife of an old friend?

197
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,500
Can't even show your
face in there, huh?

198
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,460
Not when you refuse to
investigate the death of your own pal!

199
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,520
Or maybe you're just too busy
thinking about your promotion.

200
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:29,320
Come on.

201
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,480
Lay off, will ya?

202
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:34,920
Here, these are the copies of all the documents
Brigadier General Hughes was reviewing before he died.

203
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,800
The reason for his death must be in there
somewhere, and you should be looking for it, too.

204
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,000
And congratulations on your
new office at Central Headquarters!

205
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,300
What does all this mean?

206
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,840
Oh, I can't make sense out
of any of these stupid records!

207
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,337
Okay, a list of all the external
calls connected to the Central

208
00:11:57,338 --> 00:11:59,583
Command Center on the day
Brigadier General Hughes died.

209
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,680
But there's no relation
as far as I can see.

210
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,420
So, the reception clerk?

211
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,000
The Ministry of Justice?

212
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,420
The desk of the
Fuhrer's secretary?

213
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,500
I don't get it!

214
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,020
I can't keep losing
track of all of you.

215
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,620
I have a few things I
need to accomplish myself.

216
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,080
Their teacher lives in
a town called Dublith.

217
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,660
Why don't you try there?

218
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,180
I'll leave greed to
lust and gluttony, then.

219
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,780
What should I do with the Elric
boys if I find them in Dublith?

220
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,420
Nothing.

221
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,660
They still haven't
given up on the stone.

222
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:42,420
Arrange for them to have
another opportunity to create it.

223
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,780
You may be the youngest among us,
but you give orders like you're all grown up.

224
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:48,716
Of course I would like those boys
to create a Philosopher's Stone.

225
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,940
But we can't have them sticking
their noses into that Ishbal business.

226
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,100
I assume you understand.

227
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,920
So why don't these homunculi
create their own Philosopher's Stone?

228
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,100
They just said that they
couldn't create it themselves.

229
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,240
That they can't perform alchemy.

230
00:13:10,545 --> 00:13:13,080
That would mean this child's
different from all of them.

231
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:13,740
That's true.

232
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,320
But I've never seen Alchemists
transmute their own body.

233
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,880
Involuntary systems get in the way,
and no human should be able to do it.

234
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,820
You know that.

235
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,660
And think about it, teacher.

236
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,596
He transmutes without a
circle, just like you and Brother.

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,361
So that must
mean... Al, leave it.

238
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,040
You lost your memory
when it happened, right, Al?

239
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,000
What do you mean?

240
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,660
You remember it,
though, don't you, Edward?

241
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,120
Yes.

242
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,220
The gateway.

243
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,240
I remember.

244
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,940
How could I not?

245
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,560
The truth.

246
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,860
That's what was in there.

247
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:55,840
The truth?

248
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:56,528
Brother!

249
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,820
Brother, please!

250
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:58,800
No Al!

251
00:13:59,060 --> 00:13:59,500
Brother!

252
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,550
I couldn't understand
what was going on.

253
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:22,890
It was as if a vast amount of information
was being implanted directly into my mind.

254
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:28,470
And suddenly I knew things about
alchemy that I'd never learned.

255
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,350
Everything.

256
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:35,770
And I knew that I was just one step away
from achieving a complete human transmutation.

257
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:39,670
Mom!

258
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,890
Let me go, please!

259
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,150
No!

260
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,520
Hold on!

261
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,760
One more time!

262
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,576
Show it to me one more time!

263
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,020
The truth was inside there!

264
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,720
Everything was in there!

265
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,400
Equivalent exchange?

266
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,020
What do you want?

267
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,440
A payment?

268
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,010
Damn it.

269
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,410
This wasn't supposed to...

270
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:26,730
Mom?

271
00:15:26,731 --> 00:15:26,910
Mom?

272
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,885
No...
This isn't what I wanted.

273
00:15:42,035 --> 00:15:44,035
Al...
It's all my fault.

274
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,420
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:48,980
I understood when I
was inside that gateway.

276
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:53,740
If I acted now,
there was still time.

277
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,400
Give him back.

278
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
He's my brother.

279
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,520
My leg.

280
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,600
My arms.

281
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,480
My heart.

282
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
I'll give them to you,
whatever you want.

283
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,920
Just give him back.

284
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,104
He's my brother!!!

285
00:16:20,054 --> 00:16:20,354
Al.

286
00:16:21,478 --> 00:16:22,978
[Screaming Al]

287
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:26,202
[Screaming Al, But Longer]

288
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,840
By the time I came to, I
was already in the shell.

289
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,500
And the thing that was
supposed to be Mom was dead.

290
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,180
I saw the truth while
inside that gateway.

291
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:46,180
That's why I'm able to transmute without a circle
and how I bonded Al's soul to the suit of armor.

292
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,940
I learned it all in there.

293
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,440
You really think it's the truth
that's beyond that gateway?

294
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,320
Of course.

295
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,640
What else could it be?

296
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,860
I don't know.

297
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,400
A shortcut?

298
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,260
The secret to a magic trick?

299
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,440
Teacher, I just
remembered something.

300
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,240
That boy.

301
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,220
I saw him while I
was inside the gate.

302
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,100
That proves that he isn't human.

303
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,800
He's something else.

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
There's one way to make sure.

305
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,840
We'll worry about it then.

306
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,740
Teacher!

307
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:16,620
Don't go near that
child till I get back.

308
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:17,480
Understood?

309
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,240
Izumi.

310
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,460
It's all right.

311
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:23,580
I just need to make sure.

312
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,200
I'm going alone.

314
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,080
Those boys still
don't know, do they?

315
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,780
You didn't tell them how
a homunculus is born.

316
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,740
Gentlemen, how nice
of you to join us?

317
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,520
I'm Alex Lewis Armstrong.

318
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:47,340
Welcome you with the
utmost respect and admiration.

319
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,980
You know, you've got a real
sick sense of humor, Breda.

320
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,820
You scared us to death.

321
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,280
Still, you never know
when he's gonna strike.

322
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,614
You might as well be prepared.

323
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,040
Next time, it'll be him.

324
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,120
The major isn't in
town at the moment.

325
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,240
Is that right?

326
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,120
Where is he?

327
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,700
He's off conducting an investigation with
the officer assigned to the court martial office.

328
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,260
The man who's taken over
for Brigadier General Hughes.

329
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,720
Yeah, I've been wondering.

330
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,800
Who is that guy?

331
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,720
I believe his name is Archer.

332
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,980
Lieutenant Colonel Frank Archer.

333
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,640
So, you've heard of him?

334
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,660
He's a man dedicated
to his military duties.

335
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,380
Wait, I don't get it.

336
00:18:26,470 --> 00:18:27,624
That's a good thing, isn't it?

337
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,380
By military duties.

338
00:18:29,381 --> 00:18:32,100
I mean to say that
the man enjoys war.

339
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,670
Lieutenant Colonel, I know
I've already told you this, but...

340
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,070
Yes, you don't know where the
Elric brothers have run off to.

341
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:46,110
What are you, a broken
record, Armstrong?

342
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:48,470
But there's no evidence
they even went south.

343
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:51,210
I believe there's enough evidence
for us to investigate further.

344
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:51,930
Why?

345
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,206
Do you have someone
watching them?

346
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,290
Those children are
not traitors, you know.

347
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:56,170
Perhaps.

348
00:18:56,510 --> 00:19:01,610
But I don't have any intention of just letting them roam
around freely the way Mustang has done up until now.

349
00:19:02,915 --> 00:19:04,977
For the sake of the upcoming
battle, you understand.

350
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,970
Sorry about this, but Izumi told me not
to let you guys out or she'd skin me alive.

351
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,130
Did you ask her
where she was going?

352
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,110
No.

353
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,766
She asked me to have the boat ready,
so maybe she went to the island again.

354
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:19,530
The island?

355
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:20,730
That's weird.

356
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,670
What are you doing, Al?

357
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:23,770
Shh.

358
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:26,330
Just a second.

359
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,730
All right, now let's get
your hair out of there.

360
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:36,170
Winry, sorry, but since we can't
come out of our room... Hi, Al.

361
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,230
Hey, what did you guys
do to this boy anyway?

362
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,890
He's completely terrified.

363
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:44,670
Winry, this may sound strange,
but there's something I need to ask.

364
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,470
It's about the boy's body.

365
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,970
Will you check something for me?

366
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,422
Al, what are you talking about?

367
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,550
You mean the scars?

368
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,550
Yeah, I was surprised too.

369
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,270
What do you suppose
happened to him?

370
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:57,310
They go all the way around the
base of his right arm and left leg.

371
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,590
Al, wait a minute.

372
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,710
You don't think...
Think about it, brother.

373
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:10,210
You said you saw his face
on the other side of the gate.

374
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,330
What's wrong?

375
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,630
Guys, if Izumi finds out
about this, she'll kill you.

376
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:21,630
This won't take long.

377
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:23,330
Come on, you guys.

378
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,290
Izumi told you not
to go near this boy.

379
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,670
I can't let you do this.

380
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,056
Like he said, this
won't take long.

381
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:33,830
It's not true.

382
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,810
Tell me it isn't true.

383
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:39,310
It was... it was an
equivalent exchange.

384
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,830
Mom's body, in
exchange for my leg.

385
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:47,490
Al's soul, my brother's
soul, in exchange for my arm.

386
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,238
I thought it was an
equivalent exchange!

387
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:58,330
Tell me, do you
know what this

388
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,312
gash is from?

389
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:03,210
It's the scar
from the fox bight.

390
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,370
This is my arm!

391
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,170
Ed, no!

392
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:16,840
Edward!

393
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,140
What if it's true?

394
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,570
What if the boy's arm
and leg really are his?

395
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,720
Full Metal Alchemist

396
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:42,722
Episode 30, Assault on South Headquarters.

397
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,520
Teacher, I am a dog of the
military, and I have to do my job.
