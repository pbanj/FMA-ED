1
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,440
Roy Mustang Surveillance Log?

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,180
What's this about?

3
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,120
You got me.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,340
I've been ordered by Internal
Affairs to keep an eye on the Colonel.

5
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,740
To assist with our ongoing investigation
of Colonel Mustang, we order you to

6
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:33,900
confidentially report back to us
with surveillance of his every move.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,680
You mean, you've
been spying on Mustang?

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,360
Yeah, but this surveillance
gig's too big for one man.

9
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,680
So if any of you
want in on the action...

10
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:44,980
Hmm...

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,320
Saturday, 0946 hours.

12
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,740
With papers waiting for his approval and due by
noon, the Colonel decided to take a nap instead.

13
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,720
1026 hours.

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:56,180
The Colonel attempted to
feed Lieutenant Hawkeye's dog.

15
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,580
The dog was not biting.

16
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,360
At 1103 hours, he started
obsessively cleaning the windows.

17
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,840
Still no progress on those papers,
with the deadline fast approaching.

18
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:10,080
Then, at 1147 hours, the Colonel began
to furiously sign the papers, all the while

19
00:01:10,355 --> 00:01:11,970
cursing that he didn't
have time for this.

20
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:15,860
In the afternoon, Mustang
left to research a hot tip.

21
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:19,420
During that time, he received an envelope
from the young woman at the flower shop.

22
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,500
The letter appeared to be instructions for a
rendezvous, as it contained two tickets for a play.

23
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:29,440
That night, Colonel Mustang claimed to be
going on an overnight exploratory mission and left.

24
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:32,480
But judging by the look on
his face, I think he's got a date.

25
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,820
Wait, the girl from
the flower shop?

26
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,740
You don't mean
Grace, not my Grace!

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,980
I thought she was just
playing hard to get with me!

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,720
If she's seeing two guys at
once, she can't be that hard to get.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,816
In a head-to-head with Mustang
over a girl, you're screwed.

30
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,720
I'm sorry, but there's no
way she'd pick you over him.

31
00:01:45,721 --> 00:01:46,920
Shut up, you jerks!

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,448
They don't
understand my feelings.

33
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,840
I really thought this was love.

34
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,220
Damn, Havoc, is that a
surveillance log or a diary?

35
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,420
You take that back, loser!

36
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,291
Look who's talking!

37
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:54,880
What?

38
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,920
Yes, I love a good fight!

39
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,558
Come on, guys.

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,200
Lay down your
pencils and make up.

41
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,460
That's it, I'm through!

42
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,660
I can't take this
stupid investigation!

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,260
Ah!

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,020
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

45
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,698
Here at Central Headquarters,
there was a band of brave soldiers,

46
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:15,260
all willing to make that
sacrifice in the name of peace.

47
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,880
This is a tale of
love and courage.

48
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:21,820
A tale of the Flame Alchemist,
Colonel Mustang, and his loyal team.

49
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:02,449
Hey.

50
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,096
You know what, Black Hayate?

51
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,280
You don't know how
good you've got it.

52
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,680
No worries, no
friends to betray you.

53
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,760
Does anyone know what's
eating Lieutenant Havoc?

54
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,740
He probably got dumped again.

55
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,700
He's psychic!

56
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,320
It's hard balancing this
job and a relationship.

57
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,780
You have no time, and good luck
meeting someone worthwhile here.

58
00:04:26,781 --> 00:04:27,300
Please.

59
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,440
A man should be able to handle
both his job and his women.

60
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,000
I do.

61
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,820
Yeah, that's his problem.

62
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:33,720
Hey, wait.

63
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,060
Grief affects his
performance, which affects me.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,920
Hey, when do you guys
find a girl for Havoc?

65
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:39,780
Huh?

66
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,020
But I'm a highly
trained officer!

67
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,380
I can't find a girl for me!

68
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,945
Just toss him one
of yours, Colonel.

69
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:46,880
What's that?

70
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,020
Uh, nothing.

71
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,480
Nothing.

72
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,020
I don't guess any of you know what
he's looking for in a woman, do you?

73
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:56,760
Well, when we were drinking, he mentioned
wanting a cute, smart, funny girl with a

74
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,860
good personality who
wasn't likely to cheat on him.

75
00:04:59,340 --> 00:04:59,820
Right.

76
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,340
Fallman, scour the city for a cute,
smart, funny girl with a good personality

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,578
and introduce her to Havoc.

78
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,920
You want me to what?

79
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:06,960
You heard me.

80
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,963
That's your new mission.

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,880
A mission?

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,520
For me?

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,330
I need all the records pertaining
to Brigadier General Grand, Dr.

84
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,380
Marcoh, and Shou Tucker.

85
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,760
And include any documents regarding
Laboratory Five or the second execution ground.

86
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:20,620
Yes, sir.

87
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,980
But what about the ones that
were destroyed in the library fire?

88
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,080
Of course I want them, too.

89
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,320
That's why I've
come to you, Sheska.

90
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,220
If I can use this assignment to gain
access to the military court, maybe I can

91
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:35,360
find out what Hughes was
investigating when he died.

92
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,391
So what do you say?

93
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,340
Yes, sir.

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,248
I accept the mission.

95
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,720
Some mission?

96
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,620
They didn't cover picking
up women and basic training.

97
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,600
Where am I
supposed to find a girl?

98
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,400
That hurt.

99
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,820
I'm so sorry.

100
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,480
Are you okay?

101
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,480
Sheska?

102
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:53,420
Oh, Fallman.

103
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,920
Nice running into you.

104
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,080
Have you been well?

105
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,100
Um, yeah.

106
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,900
Something like that.

107
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:02,960
Hold on.

108
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,200
You're a girl.

109
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,960
I'm looking for a cute, smart,
funny girl with a good personality.

110
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,860
Know where I could
find someone like that?

111
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:09,594
Hold on a minute.

112
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:15,020
Are you somehow suggesting you think I am not a
cute, smart, funny girl with a good personality, officer?

113
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,718
Oh, no.
I didn't mean it like that.

114
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,200
It's all quite silly.

115
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:21,160
Colonel Mustang ordered me to
find a girlfriend for Lieutenant Havok.

116
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,520
Oh, it's for Havok?

117
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,200
Yeah.

118
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,520
So you have any ideas?

119
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:25,780
Look no further.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,940
I know the perfect woman.

121
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,980
Armstrong's sister?

122
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,440
You're kidding, right?

123
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,320
No.

124
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,960
He says she's single because she's
shy, not because she's not good looking.

125
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,020
It's so big.

126
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,600
All right.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,300
I'm going home.

128
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Are you out of
your freaking mind?

129
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,496
You've hit the mother
lode with this one, Havok.

130
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,058
You just have to convince her to
marry you and you're set for life.

131
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,620
You'll fly up the
ranks in no time.

132
00:07:02,621 --> 00:07:03,780
Marry her?

133
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
But I don't even know her yet.

134
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,420
Well, according to Major Armstrong, she's
every bit as beautiful as the Major himself.

135
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,220
You mean she looks
just like the Major?

136
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
Get your damn
hands off me, guys.

137
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,560
I'm going home.

138
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,100
Ah, here at last.

139
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:22,340
Welcome to our home,
Lieutenant Havok.

140
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,700
We've been expecting you.

141
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:24,439
Bye, don't blow it.

142
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:32,660
For the past 180 some odd years, the
House of Armstrong has played a vital

143
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:36,140
role in the nation's financial,
political, and military circles.

144
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,140
Generation after generation, we've remained
pillars of strength and beacons of integrity.

145
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,740
We've supplied the country
with countless Generals.

146
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,500
Why, I myself was a General back in
the day when that meant something.

147
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:50,860
We didn't have motor cars... Oh, father's
stories always touch me in a profound way.

148
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,400
Oh, my.

149
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,580
I hope he's not boring our
poor guest with old war stories.

150
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Oh, hello, Mother.

151
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:57,700
Mother?

152
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,340
That's a relief.

153
00:07:59,365 --> 00:08:01,340
The mother looks pretty normal.

154
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,880
She's a freakin' giant!

155
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,920
That's not normal!

156
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:07,980
That's not normal at all!

157
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,160
Think about it
rationally, Havok.

158
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,720
If the father's large horizontally and
the mother is large vertically, then it only

159
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:21,120
makes sense, mathematically speaking, that when
you combine them, the sun would end up looking like this.

160
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,340
Which, uh, which means
the daughter must look like, uh...

161
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,940
Won't you come frolic with me
through the flowers, Lieutenant Havok?

162
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,500
No, that's not how it works.

163
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,736
Some traits are more dominant.

164
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,240
So there is the possibility if you cross
A with B, it could resemble A more.

165
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,558
Here she comes, Lieutenant.

166
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,740
My baby sister.

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
Come now, Catherine.

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,940
Don't be bashful.

169
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,518
You know it's not
an attractive quality.

170
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,460
Moment of truth.

171
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,056
Does she look like
her dad or her mom?

172
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,180
Either way, she's a monster.

173
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,180
But if she's gotta be a potato or
tomato, please let her be a tomato!

174
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,600
Um, hi.

175
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,400
It's nice to meet
you, Lieutenant.

176
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,700
I'm Catherine L.

177
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,260
Armstrong.

178
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,720
Jackpot!

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,260
I told Foreman she was beautiful,
and doesn't she look like me?

180
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,760
How so?

181
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,233
The Armstrong eyelashes.

182
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,460
Oh, yes, of course.

183
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,188
Where are your
manners, Catherine?

184
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,180
Let's not be shy.

185
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Hi, again.

186
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,220
So, uh, what do you,
what do you do for fun?

187
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,480
Well, um, I'm pretty
good on the piano.

188
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,580
Aw, she's so cute.

189
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,400
She can't possibly be
related to the Major.

190
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,800
Or should I say I'm pretty
good under the piano.

191
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,700
Hmm.

192
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,320
Something wrong, Lieutenant?

193
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,820
Forget what I said.

194
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,140
She is 100% the Major's sister.

195
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
But wait.

196
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,800
If I look past her freakish strength
and focus on what matters, her looks,

197
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,380
her sense of fashion, her
estate, her lineage, it all adds up.

198
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,800
I suppose I... I really
have hit the mother lode!

199
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,040
Miss Catherine.

200
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,740
Yes?

201
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:01,580
You'd make me a happy man if you would
allow me the privilege of taking you on a date.

202
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,140
Huh?

203
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,420
Lieutenant Havoc?

204
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,200
Yes.

205
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:20,460
In my dreams, I've always imagined meeting a man just like
you, except with a more muscular physique like my brother's.

206
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,260
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,260
It's just that I only
like good-looking men.

208
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,520
Maybe we should forget
this ever happened.

209
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,747
Guess it wasn't meant to be.

210
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:30,840
Hmm.

211
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,300
Should I inform the cook?

212
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,260
Ten thousand says
he blows the date.

213
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,780
I say they don't even have one.

214
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:38,380
My money's on him chickening
out before he even sees her.

215
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,620
You realize you're all
bidding against him.

216
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,280
Safest bet!

217
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,920
That's it.

218
00:10:43,585 --> 00:10:44,820
I'll just die alone.

219
00:10:56,170 --> 00:11:00,689
Well, it looks like Major Armstrong is
turning out to be exactly the man I thought.

220
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,636
Lieutenant Hawkeye,
let's track this tiger.

221
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,020
Right.

222
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,600
Oh, man.

223
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,380
I'm starving.

224
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:11,680
I haven't been able to afford a decent
meal since I lost my money in that bet.

225
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,360
And I've been stuffing
my face silly ever since.

226
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,380
Take pity and feed me!

227
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,280
Then the bet wouldn't
mean anything, now would it?

228
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,080
Hmm.

229
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:23,020
They still haven't
fixed these lights?

230
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,680
I know.

231
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,740
It's pretty creepy
around here at night.

232
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,600
Of course, I don't buy the
haunted warehouse rumors.

233
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,640
What is that?

234
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:41,720
I don't know.

235
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:48,170
It's here!!

236
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,570
Stop that.

237
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,370
Oh, you're so bad.

238
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,270
That tickles.

239
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:17,636
Wait.

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,940
Now sit.

241
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,880
Shake.

242
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,960
Other paw.

243
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,140
Down.

244
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,160
Good.

245
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,402
Good morning, Lieutenant.

246
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:39,220
As you were.

247
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,420
Are you serious?

248
00:12:41,421 --> 00:12:42,660
As a heart attack.

249
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,918
Those rumors aren't rumors.

250
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,480
They're true.

251
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:44,712
Stop.

252
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,020
Why are you telling me this?

253
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,816
I'm not going to be able
to walk home tonight.

254
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,200
Something happen to you boys?

255
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,520
They claim to have seen
the fabled warehouse 13.

256
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:52,800
Idiots.

257
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,960
There's nothing idiotic
about being aware Colonel.

258
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,592
Especially when there's a
bunch of ghosts out there.

259
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:58,880
A warehouse 13, huh?

260
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm pretty sure that according to the records,
the military has only 12 warehouses here.

261
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:06,320
There may only be 12 now,
but sometimes a 13th appears.

262
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,940
They say this warehouse shows up on the old
execution grounds where thousands have been killed.

263
00:13:10,941 --> 00:13:14,560
When the sun goes down and darkness
falls, the haunted building mysteriously rises

264
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,898
from the blood-soaked soil.

265
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:19,780
And you can hear the ghosts of the
executed clawing their way to the surface.

266
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:20,900
Slash.

267
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:21,560
Slash.

268
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,280
They climb over the corpses of fellow
victims seeking vengeance against soldiers.

269
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,560
Did you ever stop to think that it's because you live
in this state of fear that you imagine seeing things?

270
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,720
Your minds are
playing tricks on you.

271
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,840
Doesn't anything scare you, sir?

272
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,640
Of course not.

273
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,440
I'm a trained
Alchemist after all.

274
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,160
We look at things in a rational manner
and there's nothing rational about ghost stories.

275
00:13:41,361 --> 00:13:43,940
But we saw it with our own
eyes, and we aren't the only ones.

276
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,577
I've heard stories
all over headquarters.

277
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,820
What is this?

278
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,080
A children's slumber party?

279
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,780
You superstitious nitwits need someone to
give you a reality check, and it might as well be me.

280
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,300
Wow!

281
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,040
Really, boss?

282
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,240
Did you hear that, guys?

283
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:58,043
The colonel's volunteered to
help us with our midnight stakeout!

284
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,340
He's a noble leader, always
looking out for his men.

285
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:00,938
What a relief.

286
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,252
If the colonel's with us,
there's no way we'll be impaled.

287
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,300
Now wait a minute.

288
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,320
What stakeout?

289
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:08,460
Our mission is to prove whether
or not Warehouse 13 is real.

290
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,600
And you said you would
give us a reality check.

291
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:16,260
Well, yeah, that's what I said, but... I have to go by there
every night on my way home, and it's eating away at my

292
00:14:16,261 --> 00:14:18,260
insides, and soon
there'll be nothing left.

293
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,340
Please, colonel, help me.

294
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,640
Damn it!

295
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:27,000
Still don't see why I have to tag along
on their stupid little midnight ghost hunt.

296
00:14:27,025 --> 00:14:28,796
Because they admire
you more than you realize.

297
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,040
What good is admiration
from other men?

298
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,000
They're soldiers.

299
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:36,740
How are they going to deal with living,
breathing people when they're afraid of the dead?

300
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
I didn't tell you to
stop here, lieutenant.

301
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,680
You looked like you
wanted me to, sir.

302
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,840
Oh, Colonel Mustang.

303
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:00,660
What a surprise.

304
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm sorry for dropping
by unannounced.

305
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,120
I was just in the
neighborhood, so... Nonsense.

306
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,820
I appreciate you
taking the time.

307
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,020
Elicia, you remember
Roy Mustang.

308
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,860
Say hello.

309
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,020
Hiya, kiddo.

310
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,240
You've grown.

311
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:17,960
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,023
She's just a little shy.

313
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,040
But please, come in.

314
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:28,080
No, I better not.

315
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,360
I have tons of paperwork.

316
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,580
I'll be seeing you.

317
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:37,400
Like I was saying, it's always a
lot scarier dealing with the living.

318
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,340
Give me a ghost
to talk to any day.

319
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,480
So this is absolutely
everything.

320
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,020
You left nothing out.

321
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:47,020
No miscellaneous documents
that Hughes had lying around.

322
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,180
No, that's it.

323
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,740
Very well.

324
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,640
Have all of these
files incinerated.

325
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,760
Scatter the ashes.

326
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,720
Uh, what?

327
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,140
But these are official records.

328
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,076
They're one of a kind.

329
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,800
I don't care.

330
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,100
Laboratory Five has
been closed for years.

331
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:04,380
I'd hardly expect there to be
much documentation these days.

332
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,100
There is more to it, sir.

333
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:10,887
Don't you find it odd that there are absolutely no
records at all from the years when the lab was operational?

334
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,781
That's about someone
neglecting their work.

335
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,840
But that someone was Boss Grand.

336
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,680
What exactly are you implying?

337
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,760
People don't Bury nickel, sir.

338
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,720
They Bury gold.

339
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,140
It suggests Grand discovered
something valuable enough to cover up.

340
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,580
Of course, I can't imagine that you would
have had any pre-existing knowledge of

341
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,460
this breach, Führer.

342
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,000
But think of it.

343
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,160
A humanoid chimera.

344
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,720
A Philosopher's Stone
that amplifies Alchemy.

345
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't have to tell you that these could
be powerful weapons in our arsenal.

346
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,030
And I don't have to tell you those are
forbidden practices, Lieutenant Colonel.

347
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,120
Scientific progress
is trial and error.

348
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,318
Neglecting to learn from
past experiments, or forbidding

349
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:49,540
research because it's immoral,
is not only myopic, but reckless.

350
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,140
I have Kimbley and
Shou Tucker under my control.

351
00:16:52,141 --> 00:16:53,500
Ready to be
unleashed at any time.

352
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,882
I'm just waiting for
your command, sir.

353
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,640
Apparently, another civil
war has broken out in Lior.

354
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,940
We also have reports that
Scar may be hiding there.

355
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,011
Sound like a problem that you
and your friends could solve?

356
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:06,340
Yes.

357
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,320
This is ridiculous.

358
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:11,380
Five grown men trying to sneak a
peek at a ghost on their night off.

359
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,120
By ridiculous, you mean scary.

360
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,206
Well, it means a lot to us,
you coming out, Colonel.

361
00:17:15,230 --> 00:17:16,660
Let's just hurry so I can sleep.

362
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, yeah.

363
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:22,120
Did we forget to tell you that the
lights are out from this point on?

364
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,500
What the hell has the
maintenance staff been doing?

365
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,240
And Breda said,
let there be light.

366
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,740
It's just a shadow, moron.

367
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,880
Yeah, calm down.

368
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,900
These shadows can
be your friends, Fury.

369
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,340
Look, I have a
cute little puppy dog.

370
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,660
Stop freaking out!

371
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,320
What for you to say?

372
00:17:50,321 --> 00:17:52,300
Well, stop jumping when
things stop being scary.

373
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,232
I want to go home.

374
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,840
How did I get such
a pathetic staff?

375
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,640
Come on, I'll prove to you
there's no such thing as ghosts.

376
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,120
Don't leave us alone, Colonel!

377
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,580
This, ladies, is the twelfth
and final warehouse.

378
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,297
And over there is
nothing but open space.

379
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,220
So where is your phantom
13th warehouse?

380
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,880
Maybe it's a Warehouse, like a
Werewolf, and it needs a full Moon.

381
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:12,680
Give it up, Fury.

382
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,696
Hold on, I think I know what
you guys saw the other night.

383
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,640
Take a look over there.

384
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:17,480
Hmm?

385
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,840
That letter B.

386
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,340
Doesn't that look an awful
lot like... The number 13.

387
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,420
I guess I see how you
can make that mistake.

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,700
So you misread it thanks to
the darkness and your own fears.

389
00:18:29,485 --> 00:18:30,856
I guess that's better
than the alternative.

390
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,860
I told you it was a figment
of your own imagination.

391
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,432
But then what about the ghosts?

392
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,840
They don't exist either, Fury.

393
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,700
Oh, good.

394
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,000
Whew, starting tomorrow night I
can take my normal route home.

395
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,436
And we're all happy for you.

396
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,360
Can we go now?

397
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:45,780
You know, now that my nausea's
settling down, I'm getting kinda hungry.

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,380
Yeah, I could go for some grub.

399
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,480
Dinner's on you guys.

400
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:48,912
What?

401
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:49,660
But I'm broke!

402
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,876
Consider it
payment for causing this trouble.

403
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,340
Hold up.

404
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,380
What's wrong?

405
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,400
You see that?

406
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:56,700
See what?

407
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,580
The dirt.

408
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,036
It looks like it's
been dug through.

409
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,983
That doesn't sound good.

410
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,380
Fallman.

411
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,100
Yes, sir.

412
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,060
I found something.

413
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,800
Yeah, it's a bone.

414
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,660
The dead really are
digging themselves up!

415
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,656
Look at how this could be
the haunted execution ground!

416
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,334
Pull it together.

417
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,460
Even if this was where they executed
people, they wouldn't have buried them here.

418
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,360
This is more likely
the work of a murderer.

419
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:36,226
I think this bone is our only evidence of a
crime that someone would rather have forgotten.

420
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,280
But what killer in their right mind would
sneak onto military soil to dump a body?

421
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,820
Unless this could be the result
of an incident within the military.

422
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,656
I'd say there's a
strong chance of that.

423
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,800
We may be looking at
the bone of a slain soldier.

424
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,920
Our mission is to identify who our victim was,
where they came from, and if we can, how they died.

425
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,460
Don't miss personal effects.

426
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,460
And it may not all be buried
in one spot, so spread out!

427
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,460
You got it!

428
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,750
Well, I can't exactly
say I was expecting that.

429
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,680
Who the hell is
responsible for this fiasco?!

430
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,910
So how was your night?

431
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,250
I've had better.

432
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,190
Hello?

433
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:12,790
Colonel, the
Tiger's on the prowl.

434
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:16,590
I fully expect you to
deliver us to victory.

435
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:17,330
Excuse me.

436
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:17,910
Hm?

437
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,370
What is it?

438
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,350
Führer, I'm requesting permission
to join this Eastern campaign.

439
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:24,248
I'm afraid you've
come too late, Colonel.

440
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,923
Major Armstrong's already been
assigned to help me with command.

441
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:30,470
With respect, the Major hasn't served on the
front line since he was hurt in the Ishbal War.

442
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:35,570
Now is hardly the time to redeploy him into combat,
especially in a region where he has no recent experience.

443
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:40,810
I also feel partly responsible for this
latest uprising, seeing as how I was

444
00:21:40,811 --> 00:21:42,580
formerly stationed at
the Eastern headquarters.

445
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,550
Please, let me tag along.

446
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:45,370
Hm.

447
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,910
I have no objections
to his request.

448
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,030
Very well.

449
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,371
Colonel Mustang, you are hereby ordered to accompany
the expeditionary forces to suppress the insurrection.

450
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:55,910
I accept it with honor, sir.

451
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,690
Full Metal Alchemist

452
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:42,244
Episode 38,
With the River's Flow.

453
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:51,930
In the past when we fought, and it seemed like we'd never
be happy again, I'd always go sit by the river's edge.
