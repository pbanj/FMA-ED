1
00:01:42,563 --> 00:01:43,256
Brother...

2
00:01:51,853 --> 00:01:53,519
EDWARD!!!

3
00:01:57,138 --> 00:01:58,548
was too easy.

4
00:01:58,572 --> 00:01:59,732
Humans are so pathetic.

5
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,740
Brother no, you can't die.

6
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,860
It's supposed to be me.

7
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:08,146
He's dead?

8
00:02:08,548 --> 00:02:09,328
That's right.

9
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,060
He's setting the pace for every human to
follow.

10
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:15,800
Now we'll kill off each one of them until
only Homunculi are left.

11
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:22,152
[Laughs in douchebag]

12
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:23,655
Brother can't die.

13
00:02:23,986 --> 00:02:24,946
That's ridiculous.

14
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,540
He wouldn't let that happen.

15
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,660
He couldn't.

16
00:02:28,175 --> 00:02:29,695
That's reality for you.

17
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,779
All the effort he gave got him nothing in
return.

18
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:34,715
You can pay all you want.

19
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:36,553
It's never enough.

20
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,745
Hey, you all right?

21
00:03:02,632 --> 00:03:03,512
Colonel Archer?

22
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:05,919
Give me your car.

23
00:03:07,593 --> 00:03:08,873
Where are you headed to, sir?

24
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:10,386
The Führer's mansion.

25
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:12,793
The rebels are there, right?

26
00:03:13,486 --> 00:03:15,006
That was a false alarm, Colonel.

27
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,740
We've just come back from there.

28
00:03:17,213 --> 00:03:18,773
It was Lieutenant Hawkeye.

29
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:19,820
Hawkeye?

30
00:03:22,034 --> 00:03:23,408
And you let her live?

31
00:03:30,181 --> 00:03:31,581
Hold your fire, Colonel!

32
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:34,186
The Führer wants her interrogated at
Headquarters, sir!

33
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,700
Have you seen Headquarters?

34
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,519
We're in a war zone!

35
00:03:37,859 --> 00:03:39,471
Rebels are everywhere!

36
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,126
We don't have time for questioning!

37
00:03:41,646 --> 00:03:42,946
Let me kill her!

38
00:03:54,827 --> 00:03:58,334
Is my species of consequence to you now?

39
00:03:59,511 --> 00:04:02,831
I haven't had the chance to test my
Homunculus traits much.

40
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:06,030
I wanted to see what would happen if I let
my whole body explode.

41
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:11,749
You really wanted my position badly,
didn't you, Mustang?

42
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:18,185
I can appreciate the vanity of ambition, but
you should have been more patient about it.

43
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,589
Even if this had somehow worked,
the Council would have found you out and

44
00:04:22,614 --> 00:04:24,990
they'd never let an assassin back into
their fold.

45
00:04:25,789 --> 00:04:27,290
I didn't do this for politics.

46
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,350
I couldn't forgive myself for being blind
this long.

47
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,020
This was the only way I could
atone for the friends I didn't save.

48
00:04:34,616 --> 00:04:37,336
Well, then by all means, let me help you
with that.

49
00:04:37,656 --> 00:04:40,222
Give my best regards to General Hughes.

50
00:04:45,529 --> 00:04:46,269
What's going on?

51
00:04:49,193 --> 00:04:49,953
Hello, son.

52
00:04:50,643 --> 00:04:51,835
Good news, I've caught the rat.

53
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,626
I'm sorry that I disobeyed you,
Father, but I just had to come back.

54
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:59,842
I forgot something and I wanted to make
sure that you were okay.

55
00:05:06,103 --> 00:05:06,983
So what now?

56
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:10,396
You said people are foolish, so how do you
explain loving him?

57
00:05:13,544 --> 00:05:14,670
Father, what's the matter?

58
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,005
You look like you're hurt.

59
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,530
What's wrong?

60
00:05:17,037 --> 00:05:19,546
What have you done, you idiot?

61
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:23,389
I just... I got it from your safe.

62
00:05:23,525 --> 00:05:26,937
You said your life depended on it and I
didn't want it to get hurt in the fire.

63
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:31,397
Father.

64
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:33,197
Stop!

65
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:42,924
You are foolish.

66
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:44,184
All of you.

67
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:46,017
Even my own son.

68
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:03,203
I don't know how you've lived Führer.

69
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:06,903
Or how many times you've
cheated death, but not anymore.

70
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,480
It's the end of the line.

71
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,790
Don't do this!

72
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:25,090
That sound, what did he just do?

73
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:27,030
Gluttony.

74
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,604
He used alchemy, with a stone.

75
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:44,665
You petulant boy, look at the damage
you've inflicted on yourself!

76
00:06:44,859 --> 00:06:47,019
Sit down before you're wasted completely!

77
00:06:47,044 --> 00:06:47,795
Stay back!

78
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:50,636
You can't make me do anything!

79
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
And what do you think you can pull off?

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,020
Brother hasn't been dead for long.

81
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,740
Look, there's still some color in his
face.

82
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,693
His soul is probably still at the gate.

83
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,940
I just have to pull it back.

84
00:07:14,915 --> 00:07:16,920
The same way he did for me.

85
00:07:17,115 --> 00:07:19,395
Don't be a fool, you know what would
happen to you.

86
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,267
Yeah, I do!

87
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,259
A lot of people died to make this stone.

88
00:07:23,726 --> 00:07:26,105
And I would have died too, if not for
them.

89
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,059
And it's time I gave my share,
and made my own choice.

90
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:31,333
Alphonse.

91
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:32,959
Goodbye, Rose.

92
00:07:37,043 --> 00:07:38,493
This is for you, brother.

93
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,846
I'll miss you.

94
00:09:04,991 --> 00:09:05,548
General!

95
00:09:07,723 --> 00:09:08,323
General!

96
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:11,105
Dammit, Roy Mustang, talk to me!

97
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:30,115
Al.

98
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,540
What.... What's going on?

99
00:09:34,347 --> 00:09:35,727
Where am I, you worm?

100
00:09:36,039 --> 00:09:36,899
The gate.

101
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,649
So what's on the other side of it?

102
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,035
I don't know.

103
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,155
For me, it was a place called London,
if I remember right.

104
00:09:50,393 --> 00:09:51,713
That's what my old man said.

105
00:09:52,293 --> 00:09:53,013
Old man?

106
00:09:53,588 --> 00:09:54,961
You mean Hohenheim of Light?

107
00:09:55,253 --> 00:09:55,693
Yes.

108
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,713
You're telling me he's still alive?

109
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:06,986
I wouldn't do that.

110
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,420
There's no way to know where it will lead
for you.

111
00:10:09,955 --> 00:10:11,255
Like hell there isn't!

112
00:10:11,587 --> 00:10:13,667
I'll tell it exactly where to take me!

113
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,580
I've come to kill him!

114
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:18,639
Take me to Hohenheim of Light!

115
00:10:32,325 --> 00:10:34,025
Stop messing with me!

116
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,323
You'll do as I tell you!

117
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,033
You're taking me to see Hohenheim!

118
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:42,722
To that bastard!

119
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:45,569
To my father!

120
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:06,403
Al.

121
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:15,819
Edward?

122
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,460
Can you hear me?

123
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,187
Yeah.

124
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:25,243
But what am I crying for?

125
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:28,488
Al?

126
00:11:31,834 --> 00:11:33,895
He used alchemy to bring you back,
Ed.

127
00:11:34,199 --> 00:11:35,059
After you died.

128
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,063
The Philosopher's Stone.

129
00:11:40,689 --> 00:11:43,609
He used it to fix my body and pull my soul
from the gate.

130
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,590
But then what happened to him?

131
00:11:50,395 --> 00:11:51,253
Don't tell me...

132
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,053
Don't tell me he's gone, Rose.

133
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:56,680
Al!

134
00:11:57,513 --> 00:11:57,973
Al!

135
00:11:58,787 --> 00:11:59,433
Al!!!

136
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:12,979
Damn that child.

137
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,680
How could he squander the stone like that
with my body in such terrible condition?

138
00:12:18,699 --> 00:12:21,359
I'll have to send Pride down there to
teach those boys a lesson.

139
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:31,010
Dammit, gluttony!

140
00:12:31,205 --> 00:12:32,370
What are you doing here?

141
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,670
I don't have time for this!

142
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:37,350
You don't understand me, do you?

143
00:12:37,446 --> 00:12:38,545
Just hold on.

144
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:41,143
We'll find you something to eat soon,
okay?

145
00:12:54,196 --> 00:12:55,476
You'd better get moving.

146
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:59,989
I hate to ask this, but could you take him
to the surface too?

147
00:13:02,665 --> 00:13:03,665
What about you?

148
00:13:04,193 --> 00:13:06,585
I'll destroy this place down to the last
plank.

149
00:13:07,056 --> 00:13:11,016
So no one ever gets the idea to create a
Philosopher's Stone this way again.

150
00:13:11,756 --> 00:13:12,516
Very well.

151
00:13:13,095 --> 00:13:15,325
I'm sure whatever happens, you'll find
your way out.

152
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:16,705
You've got strong legs.

153
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,810
You'll get up and use them, won't you,
Edward?

154
00:13:25,134 --> 00:13:30,250
If what my dad said about the Gate is true,
Al's old body and mine should still be there.

155
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,650
And now his soul is there too.

156
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:34,947
Maybe life has no equal trade.

157
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:38,589
Maybe you can give up all you've got and
get nothing back.

158
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:40,670
But still...

159
00:13:41,572 --> 00:13:44,212
Even if I can't prove it's true,
I have to try.

160
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,596
For your sake, Al.

161
00:14:03,013 --> 00:14:03,847
Dear Winry.

162
00:14:04,246 --> 00:14:06,036
It was nice to hear from you again.

163
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,690
Central is finally settling down to some
normalcy.

164
00:14:09,895 --> 00:14:14,090
After the fall of Führer King Bradley,
the new government didn't waste any time

165
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:18,657
taking over, and the military surrendered
control of the state back to the old assembly.

166
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:23,710
But that doesn't mean the end of war,
with several neighboring states still

167
00:14:23,711 --> 00:14:26,755
vying for power and reacting to old
wounds.

168
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:32,495
There is good news, though.

169
00:14:32,988 --> 00:14:36,150
The assembly has voted to completely
reverse the Ishbalan policy.

170
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,456
They're going to help them rebuild on
their old land.

171
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,470
It's going to be a hard road, but I
believe there's reason for hope.

172
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:48,823
It's still going to be a while before General
Mustang is ready to come back to work.

173
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:51,676
But I think his influence will help a lot.

174
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,030
What's the frown for?

175
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:58,012
The plan was perfect.

176
00:14:58,037 --> 00:14:58,777
You did your part.

177
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,890
But I should have gotten there sooner to
protect you.

178
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,830
Nothing's perfect.

179
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,410
The world's not perfect.

180
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,830
But it's there for us, trying the best it
can.

181
00:15:08,263 --> 00:15:10,598
That's what makes it so damn beautiful.

182
00:15:13,844 --> 00:15:15,090
Just shut up and eat.

183
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:26,092
Needless to say, I was shocked to hear
about Al.

184
00:15:28,868 --> 00:15:32,068
So when they found him, he was a
ten-year-old boy again?

185
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,560
With no memories of anything that took
place in

186
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:40,595
these last four years? As if all he'd done since
their mother back had never happened at all.

187
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:44,567
Have any of those memories returned to him
since you wrote me last?

188
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:47,899
And what about Ed?

189
00:15:48,506 --> 00:15:49,306
Any news?

190
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:51,600
I know that must be hard for you.

191
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,181
Teacher!

192
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:04,275
I still can't get my head around all this.

193
00:16:04,491 --> 00:16:06,251
Do you think Edward's really gone for
good?

194
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:08,935
There's no way to know what Ed paid to
make this happen.

195
00:16:09,167 --> 00:16:11,187
A life for a life has never been enough.

196
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,900
It's possible he traded with experience.

197
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,160
That the value of the memories they shared together these
four years became payment for getting Al back as he is.

198
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:25,400
Lately, he can't last an hour without
sticking his nose in an alchemy book.

199
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:26,920
It's like the old days.

200
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,500
It comforts him, I think.

201
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,180
Reminds him of Ed.

202
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:36,040
Meanwhile, that boy named Wrath got some
help.

203
00:16:36,313 --> 00:16:39,813
Winry and I fitted him with a brand new
automail arm and leg.

204
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,840
Our latest model she'd been designing for
Ed.

205
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:44,825
And where is he today?

206
00:16:45,183 --> 00:16:46,833
He wandered off days ago.

207
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,120
That sounds like him.

208
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,860
You really want to train again?

209
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:57,980
Mm-hmm.

210
00:16:58,566 --> 00:17:00,206
At your place, if I could.

211
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,180
May I, teacher?

212
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,360
Please.

213
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,220
We learned so much from you the first
time.

214
00:17:05,627 --> 00:17:07,187
I want to know more alchemy.

215
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:08,560
And more on equivalent exchange.

216
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:12,796
So that one day soon, I can be with
Brother again.

217
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,480
I've no idea how to make that work.

218
00:17:20,113 --> 00:17:24,433
But if... if I study hard enough,
I will find a way to bring him back.

219
00:17:25,061 --> 00:17:26,621
I can't explain it.

220
00:17:26,832 --> 00:17:27,992
I just know.

221
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:28,547
Al...

222
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:30,245
Will you let me?

223
00:17:41,063 --> 00:17:42,683
Can't say no to that face.

224
00:17:47,656 --> 00:17:50,336
Now, Al, I want you to promise me
something.

225
00:17:51,745 --> 00:17:52,825
I'll study, too.

226
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:56,350
To be the best mechanic I can be,
however that may help down the road.

227
00:17:57,216 --> 00:17:59,656
So in exchange, you have to promise me,
okay?

228
00:18:00,376 --> 00:18:02,896
Promise you'll come home safely,
so I can help you.

229
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,200
You got a deal.

230
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,310
I'll find a way to bring Brother back,
and then we'll all be a perfect team.

231
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,170
Exitus acta probat.

232
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,350
Tau se stes ca vestman rhein.

233
00:18:24,817 --> 00:18:27,086
Bei Tag und auch bei Munterscheid.

234
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,550
Blick doch gleich durch das Firmament.

235
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,420
Elig Finns es doch fundament.

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,180
Brothers, let's adjourn for the day.

237
00:18:37,445 --> 00:18:41,325
I want to thank you for sharing your time
with us, Professor Hohenheim.

238
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:44,715
You really believe that knowledge can come
from this sorcery?

239
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:48,283
The Thule Society knows certain truths
about the Aryan race.

240
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:51,190
We come from an island long forgotten by
the modern world.

241
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:55,910
Communicating with the ancients will teach
us what we've lost, and help us fulfill our destiny.

242
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,783
We are counting on your continued help,
Professor.

243
00:19:00,056 --> 00:19:00,905
Not to worry.

244
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,890
As you know, I'm a hunter of lost
knowledge myself, Professor Haushofer.

245
00:19:08,244 --> 00:19:09,244
Excuse me, where are you going?

246
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,010
Very expensive.

247
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:11,370
Monty!

248
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:12,390
Monty!

249
00:19:18,472 --> 00:19:20,252
Fourteen marks for a piece of fruit?

250
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:21,539
It's absurd.

251
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:23,201
And absolutely ridiculous.

252
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,683
How long is this inflation going to last?

253
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,480
Have a wonderful day.

254
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:30,319
I want to show you something.

255
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,260
Show me what?

256
00:19:50,643 --> 00:19:52,513
Planning a trip, Edward?

257
00:19:52,946 --> 00:19:53,506
Look.

258
00:19:56,273 --> 00:20:00,115
The liquid fuel rocket, Robert Hutchings Goddard.

259
00:20:00,514 --> 00:20:01,315
He's an American.

260
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:05,000
But there's another guy studying the same
thing in Transylvania right now.

261
00:20:05,001 --> 00:20:07,460
Wouldn't happen to be named Dracula,
would he?

262
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,900
Nah, it's Hermann Oberth.

263
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:10,475
He's been a student here in Munich.

264
00:20:10,733 --> 00:20:11,733
I'm gonna see him.

265
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:13,613
You mind telling me why?

266
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,579
He thinks he can get to outer space in a
rocket.

267
00:20:17,606 --> 00:20:20,115
No one knows exactly what's up there
beyond the atmosphere.

268
00:20:20,279 --> 00:20:21,241
Maybe it's like the gate.

269
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:23,667
A portal between different worlds.

270
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:25,926
Haven't you studied Einstein's theories?

271
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,020
No one believes him.

272
00:20:28,555 --> 00:20:30,915
If you can't use alchemy, you'll go buy
machines.

273
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,180
Is that the plan, son?

274
00:20:34,327 --> 00:20:36,095
I know that my alchemy did something.

275
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,420
I saw Al put back together at the gate,
and I thought it was for me.

276
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:43,595
But then I woke up here, and until I
understand why, I have to keep working.

277
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,472
You knew the only way to keep your body and mind
was to come to this side, so you did it without thinking.

278
00:20:48,927 --> 00:20:50,786
Subconsciously, as Freud would say.

279
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:51,840
Still.

280
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,480
But Al returned to me, I lost again.

281
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,700
I should have found a better method.

282
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,566
But nothing's ever perfect.

283
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:00,777
Haven't you realized that yet?

284
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:04,260
Earth turns on a tilted axis, just doing
the best it can.

285
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:13,303
It's wrong.

286
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,061
I thought I made an equal exchange.

287
00:21:15,593 --> 00:21:17,783
My body, mind, and soul for his.

288
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,630
Yet here I am, still alive.

289
00:21:21,431 --> 00:21:24,515
So does that mean Dante was right,
except to the opposite extreme,

290
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,746
and I got something for nothing?

291
00:21:25,776 --> 00:21:31,187
Or does it mean that in reality, Al wasn't...
You boys had a long journey together.

292
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,565
All the people you helped along the way.

293
00:21:33,914 --> 00:21:35,114
All the hardships.

294
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,370
The pain of losing friends you loved.

295
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:38,589
The determination.

296
00:21:38,836 --> 00:21:40,081
Sweat and blood.

297
00:21:41,188 --> 00:21:44,311
Don't you think that may have been the
price you paid?

298
00:21:56,930 --> 00:21:58,510
I don't know how to get back to you.

299
00:21:59,897 --> 00:22:01,484
This world's a strange place.

300
00:22:02,605 --> 00:22:04,105
But one thing's for sure.

301
00:22:04,629 --> 00:22:06,204
I will find a way.

302
00:22:06,956 --> 00:22:08,916
We'll be together soon, Al.

303
00:22:12,907 --> 00:22:17,187
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

304
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,120
To obtain, something of equal value must
be lost.

305
00:22:22,013 --> 00:22:25,273
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

306
00:22:25,993 --> 00:22:31,493
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

307
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,880
But the world isn't perfect.

308
00:22:34,549 --> 00:22:36,520
And the law is incomplete.

309
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:41,460
Equivalent exchange doesn't encompass
everything that goes on here.

310
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,875
But I still choose to believe in its
principle.

311
00:22:45,254 --> 00:22:47,914
That all things do come at a price.

312
00:22:48,274 --> 00:22:50,215
That there's an ebb and a flow.

313
00:22:50,677 --> 00:22:51,395
A cycle.

314
00:22:51,939 --> 00:22:55,085
That the pain we went
through, did have a reward.

315
00:22:55,205 --> 00:22:58,125
That anyone who determined and perseveres.

316
00:22:58,385 --> 00:23:01,345
Will get something of value in return.

317
00:23:01,526 --> 00:23:03,552
Even if it's not what they expected.

318
00:23:04,018 --> 00:23:07,718
I don't think of equivalent exchange
as a law of the world anymore.

319
00:23:08,632 --> 00:23:10,635
I think of it as a promise.

320
00:23:10,979 --> 00:23:12,539
Between my brother and me.

321
00:23:13,593 --> 00:23:17,173
A promise that someday, we'll see each
other again.
