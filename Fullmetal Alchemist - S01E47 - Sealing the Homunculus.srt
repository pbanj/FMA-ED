1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:04,540
Now, come with me, my Alphonse.

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,480
I know it must have hurt, the doctor using
you like that, but you're going to be fine.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:11,760
See?

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:14,360
It's just like when
you were little.

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:25,280
Mom..

6
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:29,056
Yes.

7
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,019
Mommy...

8
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:36,951
Mommy.

9
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,353
The Philosopher's Stone.

10
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,280
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange and alchemy.

11
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,680
They gain without sacrifice,
create without equal exchange.

12
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,060
We searched for
it, and we found it.

13
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,820
Please, let me try it again.

14
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I know I can fix her.

15
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,720
Please, Al.

16
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,280
You've already gotten what
you wished for, Dr. Tucker.

17
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,080
Brother...

18
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,060
I should have known.

19
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,840
Step away right now.

20
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,260
Brother, you don't understand.

21
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,980
Yeah, she got to me too, Al.

22
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
But it's lies.

23
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,560
She's not our mother.

24
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:39,340
I know what she is, alright, but still...
She's using our memories to manipulate us.

25
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,000
Period.

26
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,480
That thing doesn't have a soul.

27
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,900
You weren't always
so cruel, Edward, dear.

28
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,680
Please, Al.

29
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,540
Once more.

30
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,020
Tucker.

31
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,080
You could have killed Al
by bringing him here alone.

32
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,640
The stone has
equivalency, after all.

33
00:04:57,980 --> 00:04:59,200
He used it, Ed.

34
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,900
And this is what it took.

35
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,900
So he tricked you into
coming here and then did this?

36
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,100
Damn it, there's so many
idiots whose asses I have to kick!

37
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,576
I'll have to start carrying a list
just to keep track of them all!

38
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,460
Come on, Al.

39
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,340
Let's get moving.

40
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,240
You don't need to worry, Edward.

41
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,040
Why?

42
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,040
You planning to bring my brother
back to his real body for me?

43
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,141
Or are you just gonna bring him back to
your master and use him till there's nothing left?

44
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,940
Al, step away!

45
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,340
Don't be stupid, Al!

46
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,290
Edward, you're hurting me.

47
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,380
Nice try, but I know it takes
more than that to kill you!

48
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,240
Your mother was talking to you.

49
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,160
What is this?

50
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,920
It's the same array that was at
Dante's house when I killed Greed.

51
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,180
It's designed to
seal a Homunculus!

52
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:15,204
Isn't it!

53
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,180
That's very clever of you, but
you're going to need more than that.

54
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:20,860
Oh, don't worry, I know.

55
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,100
The remains of
the human that died.

56
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,560
The one the transmutation that
created you was supposed to bring back.

57
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,240
It can cripple you.

58
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,930
Brother, what is that?

59
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,670
She's our fake mom, Al.

60
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:41,970
This is her weakness.

61
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,630
The real thing.

62
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:44,930
What?

63
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,106
You dug up her grave
without even telling me?

64
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:55,670
What's wrong with you?

65
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,990
In case you didn't notice,
we're fighting for our lives!

66
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:02,090
Give it up, sloth.

67
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,450
You're not going to be able to
dissolve this transmutation circle.

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,230
I made sure to carve it
out especially deep for you.

69
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:12,670
Thanks.

70
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,470
I owe you one.

71
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,290
I hope you don't believe I did
all this for the locket Fullmetal.

72
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,870
Lust, how could you betray our master?

73
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:25,230
Betray?

74
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:28,470
That's an interesting
word for you to use, Sloth.

75
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,570
What are you two talking about?

76
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,090
Memories.

77
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:35,190
Of the people we were.

78
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,759
They're subtle,
but they're real.

79
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:42,550
It took me a long time
to understand what I saw.

80
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,430
Books say we shouldn't
have memories.

81
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,656
Or if we do, it's only the emotions of
the alchemist who made us that we see.

82
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,170
But they're wrong.

83
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,470
Those memories are mine.

84
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,010
I was... I was an Ishbalan
woman deep in love.

85
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,410
No, you weren't.

86
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:04,930
Sloth remembers.

87
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,110
But she's let our master fool
her into not caring about her sons.

88
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,550
She's not our mom!

89
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,710
Or maybe she really is,
but she's not yet complete.

90
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,040
What the hell are you doing?

91
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,440
Just stay down, Ed!

92
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,600
I'm not gonna let
you do this to her!

93
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,820
Don't you understand?

94
00:08:28,985 --> 00:08:31,776
If we don't get rid of them, they're
just gonna keep hunting you down!

95
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,740
Mom's remains
paralyzed this Homunculus.

96
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,560
That proves what she is
absolutely, and where she came from.

97
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,000
We created her that day.

98
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,120
Right.

99
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,701
She's a Homunculus.

100
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:47,120
We know.

101
00:08:47,405 --> 00:08:50,420
Homunculi are born when an
Alchemist goes against the laws of nature.

102
00:08:50,421 --> 00:08:53,400
Whether she has a soul or
not, it's our fault she exists!

103
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,000
Exactly my point!

104
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,480
She's our responsibility!

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,896
Which is why we're the
ones who have to kill her!

106
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,320
No!

107
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,320
Damn it, Al!

108
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:00,822
Don't worry.

109
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,040
I'll do the work.

110
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,040
No.

111
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,800
You can't do this.

112
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,340
You had better go fetch
those remains, Fullmetal.

113
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,140
We're running out of time.

114
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,490
You were using this to
hurt Mom, weren't you?

115
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,810
Your mom?

116
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,550
WWrath, you've got a serious
case of confusion, you know?

117
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,230
I'm not confused at all, Edward.

118
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:36,610
I'm just taking away
everything that was yours.

119
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:38,850
That creature in there
isn't my mother, either.

120
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:40,910
I think you're the
one that's confused.

121
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,490
Hand it over.

122
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,690
What are you doing to Mom?

123
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,410
Mom?

124
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:16,890
Funny, that's what I said.

125
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:20,490
But it turns out that he wants a mother
so bad, he's picked himself out a new one!

126
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,290
Get away from her!

127
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,460
You were good to stick
up for your mother, Al.

128
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:46,880
Hey!

129
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,380
Al!

130
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:03,500
Go.

131
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,780
I've got WWrath.

132
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:10,480
Now, don't you think you're
too old to be crying for Mommy?

133
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,780
You can't win.

134
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,746
I'll just keep
coming back to life.

135
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:36,580
Oh, that's only as long
as the stones are in you.

136
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,660
Didn't you know?

137
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,540
And I can soon change that.

138
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,280
I'll just rip them out of her
belly, one death at a time.

139
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,580
I'll get my way!

140
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,240
I'm going to become him!

141
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,900
And what exactly
is the point in that?

142
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
What do you mean?

143
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,740
It's the whole
point of everything!

144
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,360
Why should I exist if
I'm a creature like you?

145
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,420
Using you was a
mistake from the start.

146
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,540
And why is that lust?

147
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,320
Because I can use Alchemy?

148
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,740
Or did you forget that detail?

149
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:41,667
Al!

150
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:46,714
NO!

151
00:12:48,321 --> 00:12:48,475
Hey!

152
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:49,660
I'm sorry!

153
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,700
It's not me!

154
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,520
We can't do this, Al.

155
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,506
Even brushing against
you could cause a reaction!

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,720
Yes, that seems to be true.

157
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,380
You'll have to leave us alone.

158
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,260
Please Mom, stop!

159
00:13:05,261 --> 00:13:05,500
Stop!

160
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,211
When are you going to accept it?

161
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:07,980
She's not Mom!

162
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,920
Mom wouldn't talk this way!

163
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,729
She wouldn't use
you as a shield!

164
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,180
And she wouldn't
hurt her own son.

165
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,080
Ed, what are you doing?

166
00:13:23,675 --> 00:13:27,100
Since your brother can't touch you,
he's trying to use a transmutation circle.

167
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,340
But I won't give him
time to finish one.

168
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,440
Are you okay?

169
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,640
I need you to fight
against her, Al!

170
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,200
Now!

171
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,790
This is what you
wanted, isn't it?

172
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:03,410
To be a human so
you could die with them.

173
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,030
Maybe you are right.

174
00:14:08,035 --> 00:14:09,450
Where did I come from?

175
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,370
And where will I go when I die?

176
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,310
Maybe all this time...

177
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,490
That is what I wanted.

178
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,370
The freedom to find out.

179
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,760
Is that all being human means?

180
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,380
That you can die?

181
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,680
Then why do I want
to become one so bad?

182
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,840
Well, can't you answer me?

183
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,820
You are human, right?

184
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:00,796
Mommy.

185
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:03,940
That's right, that's a reason to live.

186
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:05,400
Protecting her.

187
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,560
Al, I'm sorry for all this.

188
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:12,180
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

189
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,200
Listen, I better go
make sure Lust is okay.

190
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:16,660
No!

191
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:17,060
Stop!

192
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,180
Help me, Alphonse.

193
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,060
It's your responsibility.

194
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,320
Edward, I saw you that night.

195
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,494
There there, my dear.

196
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,500
Eat.

197
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:50,900
Yes.

198
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:55,000
When I heard she died, I
knew it would come to this.

199
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,000
After all, they are the
sons of Hohenheim.

200
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:03,750
There.

201
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,890
Our monster is starting
to look presentable.

202
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,370
Now, Envy, when you were
first born, you were no better off.

203
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,880
I saw... children.

204
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,760
There was a country house.

205
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
And a man.

206
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,780
Laundry on the line.

207
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,760
We were happy there.

208
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,080
But also very sad.

209
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,020
What does it mean?

210
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,280
When you're
human, you will know.

211
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,680
Human?

212
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,780
That's why we need to find
the Philosopher's Stone, dear.

213
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,720
So you can start your life.

214
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,580
I think I'll entrust
her to you, Pride.

215
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,260
There's a deceased woman from the military
whose records I've already altered to explain Ishbal.

216
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,480
Perhaps we could
use her identity again.

217
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,540
Good point.

218
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,460
Your beautiful wife would be jealous
if you brought this little angel home.

219
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:07,580
Right, Sloth?

220
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,340
Yes, that will be her role.

221
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,640
Our Sloth.

222
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,440
She's accelerating
the cells in her body.

223
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
She's generating
her own heat source.

224
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,140
Please, Edward.

225
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,960
Stop trying to play
this dumb mom card!

226
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,700
You don't even have memories!

227
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,840
Yes, I do.

228
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,940
What Lust said was true.

229
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:43,220
Maybe it's just your own feelings and
wants that were etched into my being.

230
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,480
But either way, I do have them.

231
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:46,460
You're lying!

232
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,960
Then why would you attack us?

233
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:49,600
To be free.

234
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,440
These memories are the driving force in
everything I do because they feel like chains.

235
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:04,280
I remember being a mother
with endless devotion.

236
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,040
Now I have none.

237
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:10,780
It's a fraudulent persona
that's been forced on me.

238
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,660
And I don't have the
energy to assume it.

239
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,860
That's why I have to kill you.

240
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,640
So I can prove this identity is false, because
no real mother would kill her own sons.

241
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,560
As long as you children are alive, these memories
will torment me, trying to make me into this human.

242
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,780
They are at war
with my real self.

243
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,860
And they could win.

244
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,820
In time, I might even
come to love you two.

245
00:18:36,545 --> 00:18:38,200
And how can I allow that?

246
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,720
I should always hate
you for creating me.

247
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,160
Brother, what are we
supposed to do with her?

248
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,860
It's like we both said,
she's our responsibility!

249
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:16,642
Mom!

250
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,830
The final proof is coming soon.

251
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:31,390
When you see how little I care.

252
00:19:46,194 --> 00:19:47,594
Brother, what happened?

253
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:48,549
Mom!

254
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:53,180
I transmuted my automail into
sodium just as it punctured her.

255
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,320
The chemical reaction with
her body made her explode.

256
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,040
Mom, no!

257
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:58,820
Cut it out.

258
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,480
She's nobody's mother.

259
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,920
Face it, Wrath.

260
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,280
It's over.

261
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,360
Mommy!!!!

262
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:15,430
You actually think
I'd die so easily?

263
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,410
You don't understand me at all.

264
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,170
Mom!

265
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:18,730
Mom!

266
00:20:18,731 --> 00:20:20,630
I want you to
wait outside, Wrath.

267
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,270
I won't!

268
00:20:21,395 --> 00:20:22,587
I never want to lose you again!

269
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,600
He fused himself with her.

270
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:40,620
And bind Homunculi.

271
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,060
Wrath...

272
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,400
You fool.

273
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,440
You shouldn't be
so impulsive, Wrath.

274
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,740
Did you already forget about
taking those remains into your body?

275
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,420
And now that you're part
of her, she can't even move.

276
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:06,960
And I can just take my time to
recompose her into a different element.

277
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,980
What do you mean?

278
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,880
Alchemy on a living structure?

279
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,700
You don't know how to do that.

280
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,560
It's something I
learned fighting greed.

281
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,640
I reworked his body's
chemistry to create a weakness.

282
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,320
And this wasn't like Kimbley's technique where
he'd just manipulate a few components in the blood.

283
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:25,160
I altered the makeup
of Greed's entire body.

284
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:28,200
Homunculi are more
malleable than humans.

285
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,740
It's their strength
and their demise.

286
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,194
Mommy?

287
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,740
What did you do?

288
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,700
I'll kill you if you hurt her!

289
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,180
Step away.

290
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,440
That's my advice, Wrath.

291
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,320
Mommy?

292
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,760
I've started a chain reaction that's
transforming her liquid body into ethanol.

293
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,960
She's going to evaporate.

294
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,800
Disappear into the air.

295
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,770
Fullmetal Alchemist

296
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,917
Episode 48,
Goodbye.

297
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:49,740
To all my friends and those I love, I'm
sorry, but this is the path I've chosen.
