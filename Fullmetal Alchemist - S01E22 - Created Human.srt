1
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:04,790
What are you doing
calling me this late?

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:07,610
Well, there's something that's
been bothering me for a while.

3
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:08,166
What?

4
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:12,686
That we haven't caught Scar, or is this about
Dr. Marcoh being taken into the Fuhrer's custody?

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,270
Yeah, well, okay,
there's that too.

6
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,310
But mostly it's that I haven't
made an appearance lately.

7
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,626
What an egomaniac.

8
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,530
He doesn't realize
the mess we're in.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:23,406
Maybe you should inform him.

10
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,510
Colonel Mustang could
be of some help here.

11
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,210
Hmm.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,270
At least with the
Elric's disappearance.

13
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,350
He doesn't need to know that.

14
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:31,930
Not yet, right?

15
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,890
The soldier detachment I requested
to guard the library is standing by now.

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,566
They're all gifted marksmen.

17
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,170
Pretty damn useful in a raid.

18
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,150
Does that mean... It does.

19
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:47,106
On my own authorization, you three can
lead a full dive and sweep of Lab 5 at daybreak.

20
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,850
But you'd better be ready
to confront whatever you find.

21
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:51,290
Yes, sir!

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:18,810
It's the Bad Place!

23
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:24,610
I've been watching you, child.

24
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,230
The first time I caught a glimpse
of you was almost four years ago.

25
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,710
The sky was ablaze
with fireworks that night.

26
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,840
Who are you?

27
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,360
He called you a Homunculus.

28
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,420
But that can't be true.

29
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,516
Oh, really?

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,700
And why is that?

31
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:51,380
A Homunculus is an
artificially created person.

32
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:53,436
A human that's not human.

33
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,620
A living doll.

34
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:00,380
No one's ever successfully
made one before.

35
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,620
It's impossible.

36
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,700
Oh, it's very
possible, believe me.

37
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,560
It's no less possible than a boy who
has a soul, but not a body to go with it.

38
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,060
You really aren't
human, are you?

39
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,960
Oh, goody, can I eat him now?

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,540
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,220
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

42
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,660
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,200
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

44
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,176
I think I get it now.

45
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,376
What this facility
was being used for.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,756
It was an operation to develop
large-scale military applications for alchemy.

47
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:40,881
Or more specifically, how they could harness
human alchemy to the military's advantage.

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:45,380
That explains what they were doing
with these incomplete philosopher's stones.

49
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,980
If you want to do you could use them
to forge a complete philosopher's stone.

50
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,076
Does that mean you know how
these fragments were made?

51
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,116
Not quite.

52
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,180
By the time I came this
room was already here.

53
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,740
Created and abandoned.

54
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,740
Most likely by the man who
had run this place before.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,680
One Dr. Tim Marcoh.

56
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,580
I can only guess his methods.

57
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,360
They're made of... Edward, does it honestly
matter any more what it is they're made of?

58
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,162
Even if they were in fact
created using living human

59
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:19,720
beings, are you capable of
restoring them back to life?

60
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,806
Using what's left of them
to make a complete stone

61
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:29,820
is the only way to give
their sacrifices meaning.

62
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,940
I couldn't have
said it better myself!

63
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,460
You're agreeing?

64
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:36,540
Their lives have no value
in this disembodied state.

65
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,760
I sympathise.

66
00:05:59,005 --> 00:06:02,105
But Al, your life has value.

67
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,129
Even in this state, doesn't it remain?

68
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:19,650
Well, you're all working
overtime, aren't you?

69
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,790
Fuhrer, I apologize
for the disturbance.

70
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,666
I know.

71
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,610
You're eager to get to the bottom
of this business at Laboratory Five.

72
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,146
I've heard rumors over the
years, but turned my blind eye to it.

73
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,470
I trusted Basque Grand had
the good of the state in mind.

74
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,465
However, if the lives of
those two young alchemists

75
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:41,450
could be jeopardized
by it, I can't stand idly by.

76
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:47,246
I'll let the Major command the exploratory
mission, and I'll personally accompany you.

77
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,530
You won't go it alone.

78
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,030
Yes, sir!

79
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:53,930
And where's the scarred man?

80
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,430
He fell into the Bad Place.

81
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:57,950
Really?

82
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,270
That's no big loss.

83
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:02,370
Greed may show up to put a
wrench in things at any moment.

84
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:05,310
We've gotta get Fullmetal
Boy to hurry up while we can.

85
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,346
Is this it?

86
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,326
Are we directly above
the array I made?

87
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,967
Behind that door is the
storage tank that feeds into

88
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,550
the room below with the
ingredients for the stone.

89
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,200
Okay, I can work with this.

90
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,160
I'll be right back.

91
00:07:45,161 --> 00:07:45,320
Amazing.

92
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,921
After thousands of years of evolution, you human
beings remain as vile a creature as you ever were.

93
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,880
And who does he think he is?

94
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,820
Some kind of a high-up
military muckety-muck.

95
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,400
I find it absolutely adorable that
you believe everything you see.

96
00:08:11,401 --> 00:08:15,900
But that thing is definitely not
the Brigadier General Grand.

97
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:20,220
You're going to transmute
both rooms at once?

98
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,436
That's the plan.

99
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,880
Even combined, there's not enough
pieces of the stone in this room alone.

100
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,760
In Dr. Marcoh's research journal, he
recommended using two transmutation circles.

101
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,380
I'm hoping to take all the leftover
materials from above and collide them with

102
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:36,400
the fragments in here through the
two circles, smashing them into one.

103
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:39,820
But I'm gonna need a serious
explosive charge to make all that happen.

104
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:41,680
I'd better beef up the array.

105
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,656
Heptagon circumscribed in it.

106
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,200
I've never seen that before.

107
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,880
Neither have I.

108
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,371
If this theory of mine
actually pans out, I'll give

109
00:09:00,372 --> 00:09:02,936
Alice body back and we'll
get the hell out of here.

110
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,760
Then you people can do
whatever you want with the stone.

111
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,280
That's very generous
of you, Edward.

112
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,950
They can't do this.
We gotta get out of here!

113
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,370
Would you people
shut up already?

114
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,370
Ha, you can drop the monk
act and admit you're scared.

115
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,185
Even a head case like you
who killed his own men has

116
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:36,590
to realize he's helpless
in here, crimson alchemist.

117
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,646
You've been gossiping.

118
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,450
Yes, I did kill my men.

119
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:41,650
But do you know how?

120
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,210
Yeah, you blew them all to
hundreds of little bits with explosives.

121
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:46,586
Explosives?

122
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:48,630
I've never relied
on anything like that.

123
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,206
Did you know that even though the
human body is made mostly of water.

124
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,650
It's also comprised of
small metallic particles.

125
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:58,870
Intriguing, isn't it?

126
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,272
By reshaping them with basic
organic compounds, a skillful

127
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:05,670
alchemist can easily transmute
a person into a human bomb.

128
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:10,390
And, taking into account the abundance
of red water we're surrounded by,

129
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:13,050
the reaction will
be even greater.

130
00:10:29,105 --> 00:10:30,705
Where are we?

131
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,729
[Multiple People Talking]

132
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:38,670
All these people... who are they?

133
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:41,870
Why didn't you tell me there
were other scientists still here?

134
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:45,830
Last I checked, scientists wore
lab coats, not prison clothes.

135
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:52,506
What are they doing here?

136
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:56,150
If I'd have performed that transmutation
without knowing, I would have...

137
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,326
Everybody listen up!

138
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,650
Who brought you here?

139
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,530
I did.

140
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,930
Fullmetal Alchemist.

141
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:12,490
I personally requested these criminals be
transferred here from the prison next door.

142
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,310
And what are you doing here?

143
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:20,390
What gave me away?

144
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,090
The Brigadier General
was killed by Scar.

145
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:24,910
I had a front row seat.

146
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,750
Who are you?

147
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,130
What's your name?

148
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,286
Well, that depends.

149
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,530
I can be whoever you want.

150
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:35,570
So who would you like,
Mr. Fullmetal Pipsqueak?

151
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:36,930
Huh?

152
00:11:36,931 --> 00:11:38,750
Maybe a taller version of you?

153
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:42,306
My, my.

154
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,150
The determined little
Pipsqueak wants to start a fight.

155
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,386
But I don't know.

156
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:48,326
I'm really more of a pacifist.

157
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,930
You should stop
calling me a Pipsqueak.

158
00:11:49,931 --> 00:11:51,490
It puts me in a really bad mood!

159
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,710
Just remember that you were the one
who started this sparring match, Pipsqueak.

160
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,866
Do you have any idea who you're
trying to pick a fight with here?

161
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,050
Huh?

162
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:12,210
The reason you're still around, the only reason
I haven't killed you, is that we were told not to.

163
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,430
But I can never forgive you.

164
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:17,546
And there'll never be a time
when I'm able to forgive you.

165
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,526
For carrying that bastard's
blood in your veins!

166
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,710
Envy.

167
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,051
Don't take it out on him because you failed
to screen the ingredients thoroughly enough.

168
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,430
I've seen you.

169
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,831
If you don't want to suffer
any more physical punishment,

170
00:12:34,832 --> 00:12:37,250
then I suggest you get
on with the transmutation.

171
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,610
We've had a minor unexpected
setback, but the ingredients are still fresh.

172
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,690
You want me to use these convicts
to make a philosopher's stone?

173
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,246
Was that your plan?

174
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,990
You really think
I'd take their lives?

175
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,660
I think that you have no
choice in the matter, Edward.

176
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,784
AL!

177
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:10,820
Brother... these people...
they're... Homunculi!

178
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,840
Homunculi?

179
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,420
That is correct.

180
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,216
These people are
indeed Homunculi.

181
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,420
Perfectly created
artificial humans.

182
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,420
They've promised to provide me with
the secrets of generating a Homunculus,

183
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,660
so I can at last bring my
precious Nina back to life.

184
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,000
Why are you even trying to recreate your daughter's
body when you can't do the same for her soul?

185
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:42,180
But I already have her soul.

186
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,680
I keep it here.

187
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,240
My Nina's indomitable spirit
lives on in all my memories of her.

188
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:54,740
I can implant those in the mind of the
Homunculus, giving birth to a Nina even

189
00:13:54,741 --> 00:13:57,880
more perfect than the
real one that inspired her.

190
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,200
Memory implants?

191
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,000
It still won't be the real Nina!

192
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,900
This pointless
chit-chat stops here.

193
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,980
So, Pipsqueak, why don't you shut up
and get to work on the transmutations now?

194
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,100
You can start by
fixing the ceiling.

195
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:21,416
I'm embarrassed to admit, but our group
is incapable of using alchemy on our own.

196
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,140
We have to rely on
others to do it for us.

197
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,736
If you can't use alchemy,
then what's the point?

198
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,500
What could you possibly do
with a philosopher's stone?

199
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,660
Same as Cornello, huh?

200
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,600
Let me guess.

201
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,720
You've got a god complex and a
desperate need for world domination.

202
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,660
I want to become a human.

203
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
Nothing more.

204
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,769
If you guys really are
Homunculi like you say, then

205
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,496
there must be an alchemist
somewhere who created you.

206
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,980
Why don't you get him to
do your dirty work for you?

207
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,640
We weren't created by anyone.

208
00:14:58,641 --> 00:15:00,320
We were born.

209
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:06,776
Given our limitations, all we could do was leave
a trail of breadcrumbs pointing towards the stone.

210
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,176
And advise some eager alchemists on how to
go about constructing the stone for themselves.

211
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,296
Wait a second.

212
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:17,296
You mean you're the ones who showed
Mugear what to do with that red water in his mine?

213
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:22,500
And when Marcoh was working here in this lab,
you must have told him about the secret ingredient.

214
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:27,180
Not to mention Tucker's experiments and Cornello's
fake stone, which I guess you were behind, too.

215
00:15:27,181 --> 00:15:31,980
We laid the fake bait, and sure enough,
every idiot interested in the stone came flocking.

216
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,480
And that's the way
we found you boys.

217
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,840
You found us.

218
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:41,000
Are you saying that me coming
here was part of your plan all along?

219
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,840
No.

220
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,700
Al and I started this journey three years
ago for our own reasons, of our own free will.

221
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:51,100
And we went through
hell to get here.

222
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,720
You're here because
that is what we wanted.

223
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:58,500
Al and I are nobody's puppets, not
the states, and definitely not yours!

224
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,440
It's an equivalent exchange.

225
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:04,140
I'm going to tell you everything you need
to know to make a Philosopher's Stone.

226
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,860
And in return, you are going to
use it to turn all of us into humans.

227
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,240
And why the hell
should I trust you guys?

228
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,760
Oh, but you misunderstand
me, Fullmetal.

229
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,460
We're not asking.

230
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,520
We're telling.

231
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,020
Do you have any idea what'll happen
to an attached soul when you do this?

232
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,360
Stop it!

233
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:36,176
You can't do that!

234
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,520
He's still a human being!

235
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:41,080
Edward Elric, I want you

236
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:58,130
This won't take long.

237
00:16:58,230 --> 00:16:58,510
No!

238
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,326
Please don't hurt him!

239
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,586
He's my little brother!

240
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,926
Please don't take him away!

241
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:03,790
I'm begging you!

242
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,350
Ed!

243
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,890
It's okay.

244
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:08,390
What am I, after all?

245
00:17:08,391 --> 00:17:09,446
What if you're a fake?

246
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,190
An imitation?

247
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,646
How would you
know the difference?

248
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,746
You see, it's something I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time now.

249
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:16,490
Don't give up on
me now, Al, okay?

250
00:17:30,014 --> 00:17:31,814
[Envy Whistles]

251
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,880
Brother, no!

252
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:40,936
You can't do this!

253
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,120
It's not worth it!

254
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,880
Foolish child.

255
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,860
I should have sent him to his
maker when I had my chance.

256
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,496
That's it.

257
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,496
You can do it, kid.

258
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,676
I have faith.

259
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,360
This is crazy!

260
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,770
Quit doing this, brother!

261
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,130
Those people...
they're... they're human!

262
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,206
Yeah, and soon
you and I will be.

263
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,530
So what's your problem?

264
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:27,090
I don't want to get my old body back if it
means having to take someone else's life!

265
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,238
I thought for sure you and
your brother would have gotten

266
00:18:30,239 --> 00:18:33,230
the message after your pathetic
attempt to bring back mommy.

267
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:35,570
You gotta spend
life to make life.

268
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,190
Come on, this is
basic alchemy here.

269
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,850
Don't kid yourself into thinking there's
some way around that, because there's not.

270
00:18:41,851 --> 00:18:45,690
As they say, death is
the high cost of living.

271
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:50,650
In order to achieve anything in life, you
inevitably have to take it from someone else.

272
00:18:50,690 --> 00:18:52,870
That is what any
honest adult knows.

273
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,770
But we're not adults!

274
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:57,762
When Edward decided to join
up with the State Alchemists,

275
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,826
he gave up all claims to
childhood in exchange for power.

276
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:04,790
So don't start behaving like a child
now, because you can't have it both ways.

277
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,646
I see now.

278
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,610
This is really the
truth behind all truths.

279
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,930
Huh?

280
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,080
I'm sorry.

281
00:19:19,081 --> 00:19:23,060
I promised... that I'd get you
your body back, no matter what.

282
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,790
Sorry, Al.

283
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,630
But I just can't do it.

284
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,420
Ah!

285
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,720
Fullmetal Alchemist!

286
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,860
Huh?

287
00:20:01,861 --> 00:20:04,020
Take your brother
and get out of here!

288
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,696
I don't need your help!

289
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,140
Maybe not, but your
younger brother needs you.

290
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,280
Let's go!

291
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,280
Oh no!

292
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
You aren't leaving until you
finish what you've started!

293
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,260
That's not good.

294
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,220
Even though it's unrefined, this much exposure
to the stone material could turn the boy into a god.

295
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,381
Come on.

296
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,140
The rear door is secure.

297
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,296
We're all set to go in.

298
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,360
We've got a blockade
around the whole perimeter.

299
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,296
Now listen up.

300
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,760
Our chief mission is to secure
the safety of the two young boys.

301
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,360
Apprehend anyone who
looks like civilian personnel.

302
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,820
And everyone else.

303
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,080
Mow them down.

304
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,520
Now move out.

305
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,900
This way, men!

306
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,540
Who's that?

307
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:06,600
Is that the Crimson Alchemist?

308
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,000
Fullmetal, sir!

309
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,780
The boy's Alchemic
power is multiplying rapidly.

310
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,780
Lieutenant, wait!

311
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,640
Good work, troops.

312
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:40,175
Fullmetal Alchemist.

313
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:48,200
Episode 23, Heart of Steel Brother, there's
something you've wanted to tell me for a long time.

314
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,140
And now, I want the truth.
