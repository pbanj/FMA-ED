1
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,410
Let's see.

2
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:12,490
These smell good, right?

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,260
This is Mustang.

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,980
Yes, hello, Lieutenant
Colonel Mustang?

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,380
This is Edward Elric
reporting at the station, sir.

6
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,100
Easy, kid.

7
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,220
Don't be uptight.

8
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,980
You know, it sounds like you've
been rehearsing this or something.

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:29,100
Sorry, sir.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:29,880
I mean, Roy.

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,360
I mean--we're boarding
the 9:20 train for Central.

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:33,600
Roger that.

13
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,020
Hey, wait a minute.

14
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,720
There's one leaving
before that, isn't there?

15
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,360
Yeah, but we had a little
detour and we got here late.

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,660
I think it's already leaving.

17
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,500
Get on it.

18
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,440
But why does it matter?

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,840
Take it or go home!

20
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,500
Hey, Al!

21
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,600
Boarding time!

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:50,969
Now?

23
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,160
Change of plans!

24
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:53,013
Come on!

25
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,210
Let's test their luck.

26
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,550
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

27
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:11,210
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,730
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

29
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:22,210
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

30
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,956
Fullmetal Alchemist: Episode 4

31
00:03:06,956 --> 00:03:09,023
The Man with the Mechanical Arm

32
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,780
I can't get a solid read on
this Mustang character yet.

33
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,240
What kind of guy
do you think he is?

34
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,170
Uh.

35
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,937
Heh-heh!

36
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:37,245
Awww.

37
00:03:38,505 --> 00:03:40,398
Brother, am I scary?

38
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,500
Please, your kindness in a can.

39
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,220
Look, Mom, he's strange.

40
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,340
Strange?

41
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,560
That's not nice, Marin.

42
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:48,220
You shouldn't
say things like that.

43
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,440
But look at him.

44
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,120
He must like armor a
lot to wear it everywhere.

45
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,400
Even on a train.

46
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,551
Do you think he gets hot?

47
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,320
Nothing to see here, folks.

48
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,307
Nope. Nothing
out of the ordinary.

49
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:04,941
Heheh

50
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,100
Geez, Al.

51
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,483
No one told me we had
tickets to the Normalcy Express.

52
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,840
There, you see, Al?

53
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,680
She's not scared.

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,119
She likes you, right?

55
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,060
Cooler than skin, huh?

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,680
All right, Marin, you've
bothered them enough.

57
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,390
[Laughter]

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,560
[Sigh]

59
00:04:46,772 --> 00:04:48,730
Guess they've had their
fill of adventure for now.

60
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,414
General, it's great you could make this trip
and bring your family along without incident.

61
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,070
Yes, the bureaucrats
say the East is unstable.

62
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,230
Gives them an
excuse not to travel!

63
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,790
[Laughter]

64
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,690
The higher-ups
sure do take it easy.

65
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,450
Makes you think we're
on a pleasure line.

66
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,830
Speaking of, where's Hughes?

67
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,122
I don't like him out of sight.

68
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:13,330
Sir, he's at the switchboard talking to
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang about possible gaps.

69
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,650
Better be vital.

70
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,250
Sir?

71
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,850
I don't like him
tying up the lines.

72
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:20,290
I'm telling you,
Roy, it's a trip.

73
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:23,190
Ever since she got pregnant, she's
turned hotter than a love goddess.

74
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,770
It's the miracle of hormones.

75
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,090
It's like this angel flew down from
heaven and kissed her on the...

76
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,352
[Annoyed groan]

77
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,570
Lousy phones!

78
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,470
Cutting off my conversations!

79
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,728
I can't do anything here.

80
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,830
You're the one that we
can't do anything with.

81
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:41,990
Now, how do they expect me to run
a tight security with a family of four?

82
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,430
What?

83
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,483
And a love bird.

84
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:47,730
So how am I gonna handle it
if she has the baby tomorrow?

85
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:48,982
I mean emotionally.

86
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:51,490
Hughes.

87
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,397
You've told me about
this 50 times already.

88
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:59,986
If you're really having problems
containing yourself, take it up with your wife.

89
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,415
I already have, Roy.

90
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,990
I talked to her this morning.

91
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:05,890
Then stop bothering me!

92
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,590
I'm sorry to
interrupt you, Major.

93
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:11,270
But let me offer a
bit of feminine advice.

94
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,818
Babies aren't born
after just five months!

95
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,790
Uh, sorry I lost you.

96
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,030
Jeez, she actually believes
we're talking seriously here?

97
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:34,530
Major breach!

98
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,650
Okay, that'll do it, Hughes.

99
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,690
I've just gotten confirmation
from Intel we're not being tapped.

100
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,350
How's the train look?

101
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:43,622
Are there any
suspicious Os or Ps?

102
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:45,790
Nope.
No persons, no objects.

103
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:46,570
In view, anyway.

104
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,710
But I've got a bad
feeling about this.

105
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,910
There's been more boarding
and unboarding than...

106
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,290
Yeah, go ahead.

107
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:55,590
There's somebody here!

108
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,350
Tell me.

109
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,790
A man on the train!

110
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:59,770
He looks like he's
ready for a full assault!

111
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:00,717
You found weapons?

112
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:01,299
No!

113
00:07:01,443 --> 00:07:03,278
He's in a huge suit of armor!

114
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:03,556
What?

115
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:04,144
Armor?

116
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:06,001
[Roy laughs]

117
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,390
That guy's okay.

118
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,170
And there should be
another kid with him.

119
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,990
Sort of a pipsqueak.

120
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,069
Pipsqueak?

121
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,192
He's right.

122
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,340
There is someone with him.

123
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,702
And he is small.

124
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:26,500
Who are you calling a rock so tiny that he can
only be seen with a magnifying glass, you jerk?

125
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,996
Relax, kid.

126
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,360
The colonel said it.

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,740
I was just repeating...

128
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,843
[Gasping]

129
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,920
No heroes today.

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,740
Everybody shut up and get
your hands over your heads.

131
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,589
Or say hello to a bullet.

132
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:53,914
[Gunshot, thud]

133
00:07:56,219 --> 00:07:59,104
[Gunfire]

134
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,482
[Groaning]

135
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,620
Who are you?

136
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,507
Good morning, General Hakuro.

137
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,700
Hughes, what is it?

138
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,900
Has something happened?

139
00:08:19,172 --> 00:08:20,367
Hughes, talk to me.

140
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,620
Go tell Bald.

141
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,000
We've got the switchboard.

142
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,100
It looks intact.

143
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,800
They didn't have
anybody manning it.

144
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:38,198
You think it's them, sir?

145
00:08:45,448 --> 00:08:47,672
We've got a call to
headquarters from general Hakuro

146
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,113
he says it's an emergency.

147
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,070
Patch it through.

148
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,112
It's me.

149
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,320
Lieutenant Colonel Mustang.

150
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,219
You there?

151
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,151
Speaking for the Eastern
Liberation Front Blue Squad.

152
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,973
The name is Bald.

153
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:04,006
We've got the train
and your general.

154
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,920
What do you want?

155
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,242
Don't play stupid.

156
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,300
We lost contact with one
of our allies this morning.

157
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,740
Someone who was supposed
to deliver a manifesto to you.

158
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,315
I don't know what you mean.

159
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,573
Okay, fine.

160
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,680
I'll give you the short version.

161
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:23,620
You have our
leader in prison eight.

162
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,275
Bring him to Central Station.

163
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,278
We'll have ourselves a trade.

164
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,500
Very well then.

165
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,620
We have a deal.

166
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,140
But I don't want any fatalities.

167
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:33,640
If one man...

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,440
You're sure about this?

169
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,920
They have the manifesto.

170
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:39,514
They're serious.

171
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,920
But you know the General's
policy on negotiating with terrorists.

172
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,700
He'll hold you--Easy, Hawkeye.

173
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,520
No one's really negotiating
with anyone today.

174
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,282
I've already made arrangements.

175
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,730
Something ain't sitting right.

176
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,930
What is this Mustang up to now?

177
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:03,530
If he tries anything,
don't think it'll just be you.

178
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:06,878
I'll kill every damn
passenger on this train!

179
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:36,807
Brother?

180
00:10:37,196 --> 00:10:37,656
Don't worry.

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,360
Helmet, take it off.

182
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,254
[Gasp] Look!

183
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
Bad idea.

184
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,000
You dumb kid.

185
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,269
What are we supposed to do now?

186
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,940
Don't you think they'll notice when
two of their men have gone missing?

187
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,340
And what's gonna
happen to us then?

188
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,560
They'll want retribution.

189
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,200
We would have been safe if we had
just cooperated until we got to Central.

190
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,040
That's right.

191
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,032
What were you thinking?

192
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,080
What do we do next?

193
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,860
Didn't plan that far.

194
00:11:14,317 --> 00:11:17,217
[Groaning]

195
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,413
[Gunshot]

196
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:24,290
Are you guys okay?

197
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:27,990
Yeah.

198
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,120
Sorry about that.

199
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,020
Your big brothers here will
take care of this somehow, okay?

200
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:46,536
Mm-hmm

201
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,210
We'd better get started, Al.

202
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:51,190
Right.

203
00:11:51,530 --> 00:11:51,910
Wait!

204
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,250
Over here!

205
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,600
How embarrassing.

206
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,860
Who are you guys?

207
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,280
Freelancers?

208
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,120
Just two old-fashioned
alchemists.

209
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,640
You don't say.

210
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,880
Well, I'm Fallman,
State Warrant Officer.

211
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:11,160
A soldier, huh?

212
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,380
You don't look like one.

213
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,620
Yes, well, there's
a reason for that.

214
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,940
We've got a special
passenger on board.

215
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,100
You know, the front car kind.

216
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,740
So that's why these
thugs are here, isn't it?

217
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,320
And they decided to
drag us down with them.

218
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,660
Al, I'm going up top to
throw a surprise party.

219
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,960
You go with him from below.

220
00:12:34,658 --> 00:12:34,973
Uh?

221
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,120
Yeah.

222
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,180
Okay.

223
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:50,910
Yeah, go ahead.

224
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,250
Get over here
quick, that damn kid.

225
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,970
Hey, there's something
funny going on next door.

226
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:02,330
Wait, you shouldn't do that.

227
00:13:03,292 --> 00:13:05,492
[Gunfire]

228
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:07,278
[Screams]

229
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,420
I tried to warn you
about the ricochet.

230
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,800
You'll only hurt yourself.

231
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,100
What happened?

232
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,180
No, wait!

233
00:13:16,813 --> 00:13:19,413
[Gunfire]

234
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:22,042
[Gunman groans]

235
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,336
[Sigh]

236
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,400
Problem bald.

237
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,800
We've lost all contact
with the rear cars.

238
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,200
What's going on here?

239
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,040
Damn Mustang's re-negging
on our deal, that's what.

240
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:32,860
Did you really think
this could work?

241
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,140
You're a ragtag extremist
group with an outdated cause.

242
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
You can't outgun
the state military.

243
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,660
Why don't you just
surrender while you can?

244
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:45,072
[Gunshot, he groans]

245
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm the one who's giving the
orders around here, General.

246
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,040
Don't forget.

247
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,940
I want a fresh sweep of every
inch of this train, understand?

248
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,780
And check the outsides, too.

249
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:56,640
Top to bottom.

250
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,640
You know, there's a
real art to train walking.

251
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,900
I'm shocked you
made it this far.

252
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,620
Thanks. I guess.

253
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,980
I'm Major Hughes, and you're
Edward Elric, is that right?

254
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:21,680
Yeah, that's right.

255
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,440
Mustang told me about you two.

256
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,040
I'm an old friend of his.

257
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,140
The lieutenant colonel?

258
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,060
Yep.

259
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,100
And he's always bragging
about that silly promotion, too.

260
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,000
Come on, Ed, we'd
better work as a team.

Well, looky there.

264
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,540
A sitting duck. [Gunshot]

265
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,260
Hey!

266
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,340
You okay?

267
00:15:18,794 --> 00:15:19,794
[Gunshot]

268
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:29,480
What the?

269
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,320
Oh, man, that was smooth.

270
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,120
Hey, you!

271
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,540
Don't mess with that tinder!

272
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,160
It's the life of this train!

273
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,020
Right.

274
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,640
Sorry.

275
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,340
Box of Tinder.

276
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,600
You can't go up there, Bald.

277
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,580
There's something crazy up top.

278
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,820
We've lost contact with
all the other cars now.

279
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,660
They said something
about a guy in armor.

280
00:15:58,820 --> 00:15:59,740
Then the line went dead.

281
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,600
What's going on?

282
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,000
Control yourself.

283
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,540
Attention gun-toting extremists.

284
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,580
Hear me all right?

285
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,520
Or did you blow your ears
out playing target practice?

286
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,280
What the hell is that?

287
00:16:15,281 --> 00:16:16,880
Let the hostages go.

288
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,860
You've got no right to drag these
travelers into your personal politics.

289
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,300
You're one of Mustang's
secret agents, aren't you?

290
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,620
Interfere and I'll kill these
hostages one by one.

291
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,920
You're just itching to
draw blood, aren't you?

292
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:30,960
All right!

293
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,940
Looks like... a pipe.

294
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,140
Okay, passengers.

295

Please hold onto your seats
and get ready for some turbulence!

296
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:41,220
Argh!

297
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,080
Whoa!

298
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,500
Here goes.

299
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,265
Welcome to the brig.

300
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:08,510
Just look on the
bright side, Bald.

301
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:10,650
You probably needed a shower.

302
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:17,038
[Gunfire]

303
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:21,330
What's the matter?

304
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,930
Don't like my company?

305
00:17:26,850 --> 00:17:30,750
Before I finish off the
General, I'll take care of you.

306
00:17:30,751 --> 00:17:31,670
Me first!

307
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:40,990
Two automailers.

308
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:41,570
Go figure.

309
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,250
You're just a brat.

310
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:47,290
Don't tell me the army's feeding
kids into its chop house now.

311
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,350
You're gonna pay
for that brat comment.

312
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,350
And no one's feeding
me into anything.

313
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:52,370
I'm on my own.

314
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,810
A little piece of advice, kid.

315
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,850
I used to be in
this military, too.

316
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:02,090
It was fine as long as
I was pissing on cue.

317
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,170
But then I wanted
this upgraded arm.

318
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,310
They didn't like that.

319
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,310
Felt I'd be stronger
than my superiors.

320
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:13,950
You see, the queen bees don't like it when
the little workers have a sting they can't control.

321
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,050
Shortly after the procedure,
they discharged me.

322
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:22,170
Since then, I've gotten a taste for
destroying them and the nation they command.

323
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:25,930
You understand, kid.

324
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,410
You've got an
arm just like mine.

325
00:18:28,411 --> 00:18:30,530
You've wanted
to be stronger, too.

326
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,150
And the military, they'll just get rid of
you as soon as you're not convenient.

327
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,250
No, I don't understand.

328
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:40,750
And don't you ever lump
in my reasons for this arm.

329
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:42,850
With yours!

330
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,580
Well, good grief.

331
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,780
That was something different.

332
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,572
Don't take any lives.

333
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,990
That's all I asked you, Bald.

334
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:48,450
And as it turns out, it seems
you did just as you were told.

335
00:19:51,110 --> 00:19:52,870
So I take it you're Mustang.

336
00:20:03,947 --> 00:20:06,147
[Scream]

337
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:10,648
That flame!

338
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,440
That's awesome!

339
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,960
I controlled myself.

340
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:23,140
The damage to your skin
isn't nearly as bad as it feels.

341
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,220
You can call me Roy Mustang.

342
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:27,260
Or just Lieutenant Colonel.

343
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,220
Hell, you can call me
the Flame Alchemist.

344
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,940
Whatever you do,
remember the pain.

345
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,420
So he's Mustang.

346
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,870
Brother?

347
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:41,690
Hey!

348
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,470
You knew.

349
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:45,690
That's why you made
us take this train.

350
00:20:45,691 --> 00:20:47,230
You put us at risk on purpose.

351
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,290
Come on, Ed.

352
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:50,090
You think I've got the
whole world on strings?

353
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,030
Anyway, you should focus
on the good news here.

354
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:57,730
The General heard about your exploits saving
the train and agreed to make a special exception.

355
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:00,050
He's letting you take
the State Alchemy Exam.

356
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,630
You're going to be the
talk of the military, kid.

357
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:05,170
Exception?

358
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:07,130
But you always
said we could take it!

359
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:08,250
That's the reason we came!

360
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,090
Be realistic, Ed.

361
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:12,890
The State's never let a kid
take a military exam before.

362
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,670
But... I guess
luck's on your side.

363
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:18,630
Good thing you took that
earlier train, don't you think?

364
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,540
Whether or not you take
the test is still up to you.

365
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,560
I'm not trying to run your life.

366
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,120
Of course I'll take it!

367
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,020
And pass!

368
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,300
I would have done it anyway!

369
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:54,990
Those people had us dancing right in
the palms of their hands, didn't they?

370
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,690
I guess it doesn't
matter what we do.

371
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,290
We'll never be
the ones in control.

372
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:05,113
There they are.

373
00:22:05,516 --> 00:22:06,369
Over here.

374
00:22:06,509 --> 00:22:07,458
Over here!

375
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,600
[Laughter]

376
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Uh?

377
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,320
Hey, Marin!

378
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,171
Thank you, Big Brothers!

379
00:22:18,243 --> 00:22:19,088
I'll remember you!

380
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:21,511
[Laughter]

381
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:22,223
Thank you.

382
00:23:38,249 --> 00:23:44,320
Full Metal Alchemist
Episode 6, The Alchemy Exam.

383
00:23:44,366 --> 00:23:45,460
No one but me thinks

384
00:23:45,471 --> 00:23:47,770
Brother can pass the
military's rigorous tests.

385
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,670
But on that winter morning,
a great flower will bloom.
