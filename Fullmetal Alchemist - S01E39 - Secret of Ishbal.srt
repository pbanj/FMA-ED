1
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,580
So that's it.

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:13,220
You girls really aren't
going to tell us anything.

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:20,237
I already told you, the alien...
Let me handle this, Sheska.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:25,090
Saying that you were lost is hardly an excuse
for crawling around in the generator tunnel.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,606
What in the world were you
doing down there in the first place?

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:27,976
Sergeant.

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,855
Can you at least tell us what
you're planning to do now?

8
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:43,750
Lieutenant Ross?

9
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,440
Something really bad's
happening inside the Military.

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,220
You need to be careful.

11
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,340
Thanks.

12
00:00:54,341 --> 00:00:55,120
I'll do that.

13
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:00,970
So what now?

14
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,770
We can't do too much.

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,010
Well, it's back home
to Resembool for now.

16
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:08,990
I'd like to speak to Ed and Al about
this, but I've got no idea where they are.

17
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,370
Well, what am I
supposed to do now?

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,626
What are you talking about?

19
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,842
You're coming with me, Sheska.

20
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,770
But what about all
my books at home?

21
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:17,670
They'll stay home.

22
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,510
Oh!

23
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:43,670
So, can I take this off now?

24
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,550
Go ahead.

25
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,570
Thanks, Strength.

26
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,690
Much better.

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:53,790
Kimbley!

28
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:55,570
Hello, Major Flame.

29
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,450
Haven't seen your
pretty face in a while.

30
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,870
Oh, I'm sorry.

31
00:01:58,970 --> 00:01:59,870
It's Colonel now.

32
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:01,371
Is there a problem, Roy?

33
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,350
You damn well know there is.

34
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,190
What's he doing
on this train, Archer?

35
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:06,250
Who?

36
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,070
You mean the Crimson Alchemist?

37
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,070
Lieutenant Colonel Zolf J.

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:10,590
Kimbley.

39
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,690
Lieutenant Colonel?

40
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:17,830
This man was wrongfully imprisoned
for crimes he did not commit.

41
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:21,990
And just before he was subjected to
illegal experiments at Laboratory Five,

42
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,810
he heroically escaped.

43
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,210
And now, thanks to his fearless work, all
the loose ends from the lab have been tied up.

44
00:02:29,211 --> 00:02:30,630
This is ridiculous.

45
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,010
Crimes he didn't commit, Archer?

46
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:33,750
I'll remind you.

47
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,170
The Führer gave me the rank of Colonel
for this operation, and I don't need to listen

48
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,370
to any lectures from
an equal-ranking officer.

49
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:41,170
Hm.

50
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,690
What about this
report you received, sir?

51
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,470
What did it say?

52
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,050
Oh.

53
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,150
Do you know anything about
a desert town called Lior?

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,620
What's that?

55
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,480
Look!

56
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:15,670
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

57
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:19,350
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

58
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,830
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

59
00:03:23,975 --> 00:03:29,310
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

60
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,400
So, you're the one.

61
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,780
Yeah, I killed Greed,
and I'm not sorry either.

62
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,340
Brother, please,
this isn't the time.

63
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,700
Marta, I'm not really sure where you stand on all
this, but I want to make sure you know where I'm at.

64
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,820
I regard you and Greed as
criminals, especially Greed.

65
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,080
He murdered Dante, an old
woman, and he deserved what he got.

66
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,260
Marta, stop!

67
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,460
Look out!

68
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,340
A snake!

69
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:54,160
Great.

70
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,140
If we were enemies,
you'd already be dead.

71
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:04,700
Greed knew he'd be sealed
again, and he couldn't take that.

72
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:08,400
What is worse for the greedy
than having nothing at all?

73
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,620
I think he wanted
you to end his life.

74
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,280
And the pain.

75
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,780
My enemies in all of this are
the Military elite who made us.

76
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,849
Those freaks
dressed up in black.

77
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,700
And the rat who
betrayed us most of all.

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:24,780
Kimbley!

79
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,220
You should eat that.

80
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,040
They're good for you.

81
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,160
Really?

82
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Then why don't you eat it?

83
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,580
Come on, you want to turn
me into a cannibal now, Ed?

84
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,690
We're close to
Lior now, aren't we?

85
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:53,370
What?

86
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:54,410
Yeah.

87
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,350
I wonder how Rose is.

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:58,615
I hope she's all right.

89
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,130
And who might that be?

90
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,390
Nice try, brother.

91
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:04,070
I know you've been
thinking about her, too.

92
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,110
Hey, Marta.

93
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:07,130
How long till we get to Ishbal?

94
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:08,110
You're looking at?

95
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:08,450
Hm?

96
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,950
At least what's left
of Ishbal, anyway.

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,420
It's worse than I imagined.

98
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,320
There's really
nothing left at all.

99
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,640
Scar wouldn't be here.

100
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,820
We're back to square one.

101
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,740
What exactly are you
looking for, anyway?

102
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,976
The Philosopher's Stone.

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Someone told us it was created here a
long time ago, before Ishbal was destroyed.

104
00:07:46,955 --> 00:07:47,801
But that's impossible.

105
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,540
If the Ishbalans were capable of something like
that, they would have put up some kind of resistance.

106
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,520
Resistance?

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,454
What do you mean?

108
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,140
There was armed tension between the Military
and Ishbal for years before the war broke out.

109
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:03,500
And when it did, it was because of an
Ishbalan revolt, in reaction to a Soldier

110
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:05,004
accidentally shooting a child.

111
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,820
So, that's the way they told it.

112
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,360
Always wondered
what they would say.

113
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:10,120
Hm?

114
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,040
But I never got to know.

115
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,480
I was locked up in
Lab Five for 14 years.

116
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,140
But that was when
the tension first started.

117
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,642
You would have just been a kid.

118
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,620
I may look young because of the experiments,
but I'm actually old enough to be your mom.

119
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,100
That old-I mean, wow.

120
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,900
We were special ops.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,500
The soldiers who
don't officially exist.

122
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,360
They didn't brief us on our assignment
until moments before we had to move out.

123
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,620
That's the way it always was.

124
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:00,570
What was that?

125
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,390
Big trouble!

126
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,590
We were ordered to infiltrate Ishbal and
perform disruptive activities on a large scale.

127
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,410
We were told they were planning an
attack on Central, and we had to prevent it.

128
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:22,950
Covertly.

129
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,810
Anyone who saw us
could not be left alive.

130
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,200
But why would the Military
provoke a war without provocation.

131
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,600
And how come no one ever stepped up
to tell our people what really happened?

132
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,316
No one ever knew about it.

133
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,220
You did.

134
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,340
Well, let me finish my story.

135
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,560
No!

136
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,370
Ew.

137
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:09,010
Weird.

138
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,690
I think I'm missing your point.

139
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,810
Wait, it's a visual.

140
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:21,090
Right after the war in Ishbal started, we
were all taken into custody without explanation.

141
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,150
It wasn't smart to resist.

142
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,670
What's going on?

143
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,570
We're soldiers like you, dammit!

144
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,630
We were following orders!

145
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:43,320
Those of us who lived
became the rats of Lab Five.

146
00:10:48,995 --> 00:10:49,695
No!

147
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Dorochet!

148
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,680
Is that you?

149
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,320
Marta!

150
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:02,525
What the.....

151
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,550
B..Behind you!

152
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:25,130
Behind you!

153
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:26,430
They turned you into chimeras.

154
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:30,490
They could further their research
and silence all of us at the same time.

155
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,130
But why?

156
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,510
They didn't want the real
reason for the war to get out.

157
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,390
It's part of some greater truth.

158
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,050
But what the hell for?

159
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,010
How could they
profit from Ishbal?

160
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,090
Someone's here!

161
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,610
Yeah, our next lead!

162
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:48,370
Stop!

163
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,520
Alright, fess up!

164
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,600
What in the hell are you guys
doing out here following us?

165
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,060
This area's off
limits to civilians!

166
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,220
We're here under orders.

167
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:13,100
We're supposed to check the
security of the old Ishbal region.

168
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,580
Then why didn't you just come ask us
about it instead of hiding like a couple of spies?

169
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,540
My brother may not look it,
but he's a State Alchemist.

170
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,820
And a tough one.

171
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,840
What are these guys?

172
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,360
Moles?

173
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,040
No.

174
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,640
I think I recognize
those voices.

175
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,660
Hey.

176
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,800
It's you guys?

177
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,800
That means the
Colonel's here too.

178
00:12:43,301 --> 00:12:44,180
Hmm.

179
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,260
Can't say I was expecting
to see you here, Ed.

180
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,120
Yeah, I get it.

181
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:05,820
Wouldn't see me since I'm so short you
couldn't distinguish me from all the grains of sand.

182
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,920
Very funny!

183
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,520
I understand you've been
making quite a mess of things.

184
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,180
Southern Headquarters?

185
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,760
And an escort train
full of Ishbalans?

186
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,340
No more.

187
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,680
From now on, you'll be
working under my command.

188
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,360
But Colonel... You were lucky
Havoc's patrol picked you up.

189
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,600
It's dangerous out here.

190
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,260
But you know how we work.

191
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:32,740
We should be able to
conduct our own investigation.

192
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:33,960
It's the rules, Al.

193
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm their dog.

194
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
And when war starts, they
put me back on their leash.

195
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,000
War?

196
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,120
Just look around you.

197
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,220
They've come on a full
Military train, armed to the teeth.

198
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,820
But, who are we at war with?

199
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:50,756
Calm down.

200
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,680
We're just suppressing
a little regional uprising.

201
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:56,296
Our objective is a city about
two kilometers to the Southeast.

202
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,000
And that's it.

203
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,196
Big guns for a
peacekeeping mission.

204
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,520
You think so?

205
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:03,138
Why don't you
come out and say it?

206
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:05,060
Scar's your real target.

207
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,580
The truth is, we're
looking for him too.

208
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,020
Why Scar?

209
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,640
What's your need to catch him?

210
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,580
He is a wanted man, isn't he?

211
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:20,800
If we don't, there'll
be trouble later.

212
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,280
Don't be silly, Al.

213
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:27,000
You don't have to go through
the trouble of pretending to eat.

214
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,880
Uh... alright.

215
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,560
Sorry.

216
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:31,680
Okay, Al.

217
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,560
You're dead.

218
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,410
What's that?

219
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:39,250
Pictures of our target city.

220
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,230
From our new
surveillance balloon.

221
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,850
I don't believe it.

222
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,290
Is this right?

223
00:14:49,985 --> 00:14:52,070
A Grand Arcanum
Transmutation Circle.

224
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,910
Around the entire city.

225
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,470
Beat that.

226
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:06,030
But who would do such a thing?

227
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:06,830
I got closer to it. I win.

228
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,850
Scar...

229
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:09,670
And why would you say that?

230
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:13,428
You wouldn't happen to know the
motives behind that, would you, Ed?

231
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:15,930
No.

232
00:15:16,131 --> 00:15:16,950
This city.

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,850
What's it called?

234
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,270
It's Lior, sir.

235
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:24,110
Last year, the so-called prophet in
control of the city stepped down...

236
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,066
and the Military was hoping it
could go in and restore the peace.

237
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:27,850
That'll do, Fury.

238
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,090
He's familiar with its past.

239
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:33,350
I don't get it.

240
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,370
An armed uprising in Lior?

241
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,150
That doesn't make sense.

242
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:40,950
They were committed to
peace after we exposed Cornello.

243
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:41,930
Not for long.

244
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,770
The priest came back, and Lior was divided
between those who supported and opposed him.

245
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:49,710
The only thing you really
accomplished was stirring up the debate.

246
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,730
Now both sides are against us.

247
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,030
Why didn't anyone
tell me all this?

248
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,990
As far as I knew, we helped.

249
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:59,510
I got the report from Hughes, and
I made the decision not to tell you.

250
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,170
But why?

251
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,250
Because it was too big for you.

252
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,530
They really don't know, huh?

253
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,850
About what happened to
Brigadier General Hughes?

254
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,550
Apparently not.

255
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,205
If the colonel told the boys all that happened,
they'd no doubt run back to Central in tears.

256
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,430
Fullmetal's work is
too important here.

257
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,470
He can't.

258
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,770
The Elric brothers have entangled
themselves in a very dangerous web.

259
00:16:32,790 --> 00:16:35,370
The colonel wants them to
be under his supervision now.

260
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,050
That's the real reason
he's keeping them close.

261
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:45,420
Uh, do you guys know
where my brother went?

262
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,720
I want your reporting
directly back to me.

263
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,720
It's very important.

264
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:56,480
But as long as you agree to all of the conditions
I've laid out, I think we have ourselves a deal.

265
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,540
Edward, what are
you doingin here?

266
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,280
Hmph.

267
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,900
Always overreacting, Mustang.

268
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:06,540
Mr. Elric here has requested to
do some scouting for us in Lior.

269
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,380
You're going to let one of our most
prized State Alchemists go sightseeing?

270
00:17:10,705 --> 00:17:13,380
It's his talents that make me
confident he'll come back in one piece.

271
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:14,800
Right, Ed?

272
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:18,440
He also knows the city's
layout better than any of us do.

273
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,340
And don't worry about
him going AWOL.

274
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,680
He's leaving his
brother here as collateral.

275
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:29,200
As devoted as he is, I'm sure
that Edward won't run away.

276
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,700
And leave his
little brother behind.

277
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,580
Why the hell didn't
you come to me?

278
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,620
Well, because you
wouldn't have said yes.

279
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
You're not thinking straight.

280
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,311
You're upset because you
just learned the truth about Lior.

281
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,680
And I wonder who I
have to blame for that.

282
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,210
Oh, it's hot in there.

283
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,610
You should be careful.

284
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,310
The way the state sees
it, you're a wanted criminal.

285
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,230
Do you really want
to do this, brother?

286
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,470
Go into Lior on your own?

287
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:07,890
Archer doesn't trust us.

288
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,130
Leaving you behind
was part of the deal.

289
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,570
And someone has
to confront Scar.

290
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:17,130
You think that transmutation
circle is for the Philosopher's Stone?

291
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,470
If it is, I'll break it apart.

292
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,630
Marta, stay out of sight, okay?

293
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:24,310
Don't you sweat it.

294
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,590
That's my specialty.

295
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,170
I held myself back from
that Archer jerk, didn't I?

296
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,010
I have to kill Kimbley and
those people in black first.

297
00:18:31,011 --> 00:18:33,650
My revenge against
the Military comes later.

298
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,110
I won't let you do any of that.

299
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:45,490
Be careful, brother, okay?

300
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:46,890
Yeah.

301
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,370
Oh, Major.

302
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:55,250
I didn't realize you were here.

303
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,630
Colonel Archer's orders.

304
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,910
You're to leave your silver
pocket watch at the station with us.

305
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:02,450
Oh, right.

306
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,870
Guess that'd be a
dead giveaway, huh?

307
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:13,710
It's foolish, Edward Elric.

308
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,150
Why did you come here?

309
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,310
I guess it's fate.

310
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:21,050
Don't lie to me.

311
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,690
You've never been
one to believe in that.

312
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,173
I've got another
one for you, Doctor.

313
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,360
Make sure that you give it the full
amplification treatment, if you don't mind.

314
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Heh, heh, heh, heh.

315
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,090
So, Cornello's
followers drove you out.

316
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,350
True for a lot of folks.

317
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:17,110
That priest turned
out to be a real villain.

318
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,030
A wolf in sheep's clothing.

319
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,910
I guess it makes sense.

320
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:24,370
I swear I've seen you before.

321
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,126
Hm?

322
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:26,310
Oh you think so?

323
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,690
I get that a lot.

324
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:31,590
Look!

325
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:32,730
She's here!

326
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,630
Lucky timing, mister.

327
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,550
You get to see the Holy Mother.

328
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,790
Holy Mother?

329
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:00,650
Who's...

330
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,780
You can't come out, sir.

331
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,340
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,160
The Colonel's
giving clear orders.

333
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,260
You're not to be seen.

334
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:10,380
Why?

335
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,980
Because I'm supposed to be dead?

336
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,800
At least let me play at night.

337
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,620
I can't.

338
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,040
Really?

339
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,540
Sir?

340
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,660
Heh, heh, heh.

341
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,240
No!

342
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,360
Kimbley!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

343
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:29,780
Hello.

344
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:37,360
Who would have thought we'd
meet the boy in this town again?

345
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,860
What should we do now?

346
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,140
Gluttony.

347
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,120
Pride told us something
lust... something important.

348
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:50,920
It was, uh... He told us to kill anyone
who learned the secret of Ishbal.

349
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,640
It's too bad.

350
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Yes.

351
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,480
He's here!

352
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,340
I can smell the Beast of Ishbal!

353
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,384
Fullmetal Alchemist

354
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,120
Episode 40,
The Scar.

355
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,056
Someone once told me that the scars
on your body will eventually fade away.

356
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,480
But there are some
wounds that can never heal.
