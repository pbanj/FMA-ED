1
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,405
Oh, that was close!

2
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:25,745
Hi, mind if I come in?

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,325
Oh, that's so..

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,356
Ooh, nice place you got here.

5
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:29,865
Gross!

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,165
I know I can't feel you in
there, but this is so creepy!

7
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:33,885
Get out!

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,785
Oh no, I like it in here.

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,636
Just because you're inside of me
doesn't mean you can control me!

10
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:45,416
I'm still stronger than you!

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,325
Oh, don't worry.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,936
I don't expect to match
you in strength, big guy.

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,725
I'm just trying to slow down
your movements a little bit.

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,125
And that's my cue.

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,945
You okay, Marta?

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,385
Just a little headache.

17
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:08,225
You're going to come
with us now, Mr. Elric.

18
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,525
The boss wants to meet you.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,385
It'd be a pain in the
ass if you followed us.

20
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:31,685
So maybe I should just
break one of your legs off, huh?

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,125
Let's go.

22
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,285
No, wait!

23
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:56,605
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,245
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

25
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,765
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

26
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:10,165
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

27
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,845
Where are they?

28
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,105
Alphonse was kidnapped shortly
after they came to my estate.

29
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,765
And young Edward has gone
after the kidnappers, I'm afraid.

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,425
And you just let
him go all alone?

31
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,416
The kidnappers dropped this.

32
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,545
In my garden.

33
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,595
The Devil's Nest.

34
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:47,035
Yes, a pub on the
outskirts of town.

35
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,395
You truly love those
boys, don't you?

36
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,675
I hope you don't have
anything to do with this.

37
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:59,215
If I did, do you think I would
have had them taken from here?

38
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:10,070
Outside this forest, in the real world,
how can you expect to protect them?

39
00:05:10,071 --> 00:05:17,255
The Blaze of conflict is fed by malice, and
it consumes all that it comes in contact with.

40
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,435
And it will smolder until people
put an end to all of this fighting.

41
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:29,655
Not everyone sees the world the
way you do, from your secluded hilltop.

42
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,215
Some of us live in it.

43
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:40,545
As long as those boys seek the Philosopher's Stone,
their paths will be lined with misfortune, and death.

44
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,825
Why haven't you stopped them?

45
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,385
I have my beliefs, but they have to
find their own answers within themselves.

46
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:53,625
No matter what that answer is, it will
be different from the one you gave me.

47
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,665
And that will be enough.

48
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,725
So, I see you still
disagree with me.

49
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,856
And I always will.

50
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,565
We're very different, you and I.

51
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,965
Our lives and our alchemy.

52
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:12,906
You're going after them?

53
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,595
Yes.

54
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,235
Farewell, then, Izumi.

55
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:26,855
I doubt the two of
us will meet again.

56
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,075
Sorry about this.

57
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:52,635
I know how creepy this has to be, but I'm supposed to
keep an eye on you, so you'll have to bear with me a while.

58
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,155
It's alright, I'm
already used to it.

59
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,655
Just be careful about
my blood seal, okay?

60
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,435
If you accidentally
touch it, I could die.

61
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:05,495
Hey, how'd you guys get
to be Chimeras anyway?

62
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,145
Well, all of us were
serving in the military.

63
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,065
We were stationed in
the east on assignments.

64
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:20,005
Some were injured, others... well,
let's just say we weren't useful anymore.

65
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,556
They took us somewhere.

66
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,845
For experiments.

67
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,425
Laboratory Five?

68
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,405
That's right.

69
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,560
Greed.

70
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,385
He saved us from that damn place and
offered all of us jobs, working for him if we wanted.

71
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,225
Greed?

72
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,285
He took us out of the cages and gave
us something we could all call home.

73
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,745
That's right, guys.

74
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,585
See, this place is hand-crafted for outlaws, where people
who don't fit in on the outside can hide out for a while.

75
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,085
Tucker?

76
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,285
Tucker!

77
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,825
Why are you here?

78
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,156
Don't misunderstand, Al.

79
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,285
I'm not here by
choice, I promise.

80
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,180
If things don't go as planned, the doctor
here is the only one who can cure us.

81
00:08:01,181 --> 00:08:01,845
Chimeras.

82
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,465
I'll be damned.

83
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,665
Just like you said,
Dr. Tucker, it really is empty.

84
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,905
But... but I'm not the one who
told them how to apprehend you Al.

85
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:22,375
It's a treat to meet you, kid.

86
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,106
You can just call me Greed.

87
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,795
I'm your new friend.

88
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,075
A tattoo of the Ouroboros.

89
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,215
So you know what that is.

90
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,555
Well, this should
go quickly, then.

91
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,290
That makes you a friend of Envy,
Lust, and the Others, doesn't it?

92
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,135
I wouldn't say friends.

93
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,735
More like sworn enemies, if
you want to get down to the grit.

94
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:45,475
I don't get it.

95
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,821
Well, Al, that is
your name, right?

96
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:54,450
Tell me, how does it feel to have
your soul attached to this empty armor?

97
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,225
To exist as a chunk of solid metal
rather than a soft and cushy human worm.

98
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:11,165
In other words, completely unaffected by
weaknesses like hunger, fatigue, and old age.

99
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,145
You could call that
eternal life, couldn't you?

100
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,125
Eternal life?

101
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,565
That's why you kidnapped me?

102
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,905
Eternal life?

103
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,265
They don't call me
Greed for nothing.

104
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,545
I want money.

105
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,705
I want women.

106
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,685
Status.

107
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:27,765
And power.

108
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:31,845
I want everything this world's
selling, and eternities topping the list.

109
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,945
Do you understand?

110
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,885
You can help me achieve
what I'm going for, Al.

111
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,705
And you will help me here.

112
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:46,605
Because if you don't tell me how your soul's
bound to that armor, I'll break it apart to find out.

113
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,165
I won't help you.

114
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,705
You're a bad person.

115
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:55,265
You can act tough
for a while if you insist.

116
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,500
Just remember that nobody's
on their way to save you, kiddo.

117
00:09:58,501 --> 00:10:00,285
So you're at my mercy now.

118
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,376
My brother knows you took me.

119
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,040
I bet he's on his way right now.

120
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,176
Oh yeah, about him.

121
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,505
When I left him, he
wasn't feeling so good.

122
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,825
You better not
have hurt my brother.

123
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,015
You let your guard down.

124
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:23,815
Now, all I need to do is use this
chain to... To do what, exactly?

125
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,375
Now that was silly.

126
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,555
Oh, sorry about that, Marta.

127
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,155
I forgot you were keeping house.

128
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,015
I like a man with guts.

129
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:45,175
But did you honestly
think it'd be that easy?

130
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,595
I mean, if you really want to hurt me,
you have to do something kind of like...

131
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,996
What'd you do that for?

132
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,805
I thought he was your friend!

133
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,965
See I've got quite
a shell too, Al.

134
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,745
Hey, bud, a little
cleaner next time, Kay?

135
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:37,796
Yes, sir.

136
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,390
I'm sorry.

137
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,656
I know what you're thinking.

138
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:46,105
If I have this body, then why
do I need your secret, friend?

139
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,705
Brother!

140
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:56,825
Brother!

141
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,025
Excuse me for the
interruption, gentlemen.

142
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,425
T-teacher!

143
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,985
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,365
Who the hell are you?

145
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,245
Pissed off!

146
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,365
Edward Elric.

147
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,385
You're looking for
your brother, aren't you?

148
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,665
Have you been following me?

149
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,085
I bet you saw Al get
kidnapped and just sat there!

150
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,765
We, too, are
following these people.

151
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,165
Your brother's safety is not our
first priority at this time, Edward.

152
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,445
Yeah, I bet it's not!

153
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,885
The military is preparing to
raid the Chimaera Sanctuary.

154
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,416
We believe that your
brother is with them.

155
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,116
Where is it?

156
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,045
Tell me!

157
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,785
A pub called the Devil's Nest.

158
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,845
Hey, hey, hey.

159
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,165
Nice manners.

160
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,925
I can see where
the boy learned his.

161
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,945
Are you the one
who's in charge here?

162
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,420
Thank you for taking
care of Al for a while.

163
00:13:14,421 --> 00:13:16,636
But I'll be taking him home now.

164
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,476
I'm afraid that's not true.

165
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,365
I see.

166
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,255
Well, you're just
full of surprises.

167
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:28,666
Tell me.

168
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:31,295
Did you break
three fingers or four?

169
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,115
Teacher!

170
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:40,375
That's a pretty weird
body you've got there.

171
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,435
I suppose.

172
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:44,135
I never did bruise very easily.

173
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,235
Oh.

174
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,046
Well, I'll just have to
start trying harder, then.

175
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,206
Teacher, where's my brother?

176
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:50,955
Is he safe?

177
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,035
I should be asking you that.

178
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,135
Apparently the two of you can't
even run a simple errand for me.

179
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,577
You're both in for a long lecture
later, so you better get ready!

180
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,635
I'm sorry!

181
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,365
No Transmutation circle.

182
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:15,535
Not even gonna try?

183
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:18,895
I have no intention
of fighting a Woman.

184
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,875
All I want from him is the
secret of his Transmutation.

185
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:23,086
Simple as that.

186
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,295
And if you get it?

187
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:28,666
Why, then I'll have the secret to eternal
life and the world will be on a platter.

188
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:30,775
This is getting us nowhere.

189
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,115
You did it!

190
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,835
Don't look so surprised.

191
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:45,355
I told you before I
don't bruise easily.

192
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,635
Don't you listen, doll?

193
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:02,875
Sig, no.

194
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:06,255
Yes, I've had my
fill of doing nothing.

195
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:10,255
It's just I...

196
00:15:12,070 --> 00:15:13,655
I can't watch.

197
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:18,195
As more babies
are taken from me.

198
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,895
I can't.

199
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:23,955
No.

200
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:26,815
Gimme a break.

201
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:28,715
Are you still up for more?

202
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,455
Grrrr!

203
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:51,575
Izumi!

204
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,115
Teacher!

205
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:58,595
Oh, I guess you've been pushing
yourself a little hard there, huh?

206
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:02,455
Well, are we done
playing games now?

207
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:06,146
This sort of business
isn't my style.

208
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:09,355
But if you don't cooperate,
I won't have a choice.

209
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,835
Get your filthy hands off her!

210
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:17,926
Hurry!

211
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:19,766
Squad Five, block the rear exit.

212
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,895
Squad Seven, take
the area around the bar.

213
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,729
The rest of you, come with me.

214
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,775
Now it's the older brother, huh?

215
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,995
Looks like everyone's here.

216
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:34,910
Tucker.

217
00:16:35,111 --> 00:16:35,735
Edward.

218
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:37,515
You too?

219
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,715
You messed up.

220
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,795
First you take my brother,
now you hurt my teacher, too.

221
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:43,915
Come on.

222
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:48,396
All you have to do is tell me how to
transmute a soul into an object and... Shut up!

223
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,275
Put my teacher
down and let Al go!

224
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:50,906
Now!

225
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:51,835
Careful, brother.

226
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,035
He's a Homunculus
like the others.

227
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,346
Hey, listen.

228
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,796
- I see. I've got
a hostage here.

229
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,566
- No wonder. Is everyone
forgetting about that?

230
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,530
Come on.

231
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:02,250
Isn't anybody paying
attention here?

232
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:03,035
Hello?

233
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:06,555
Teacher!

234
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:08,055
Edward!

235
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:08,595
Here!

236
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,885
You just don't get it.

237
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,845
I told you both, I am
the ultimate shield.

238
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,285
Teacher!

239
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,026
Izumi!

240
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,455
Hold it.

241
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,795
Let's do this man to man.

242
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:44,515
Keep her safe from me, okay?

243
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:45,595
Yes.

244
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,906
I hope you're ready for me to
fight back this time, Mr. Elric.

245
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:50,795
Don't worry!

246
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:55,035
I'm always ready
when I'm...pissed!

247
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,426
We've completed
preparations at the back.

248
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:00,115
The alley is completely blocked.

249
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,335
We're ready to move in.

250
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:23,505
Not good enough!

251
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:30,005
You know, you and your brother
are being completely dense here.

252
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:31,325
How's that?

253
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:35,260
Well, as two cunning boys who
have so diligently pursued their goals,

254
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,136
how can you not
be understanding?

255
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,625
When somebody like me
simply wants to pursue his own.

256
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,065
Our goals are completely
different from yours!

257
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,185
You think so?

258
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,556
Homunculus or Human, we're all
really the same now, wouldn't you say?

259
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:52,540
I mean, we all live to chase after our
own goals and to hell with everyone else.

260
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:53,796
Not us!

261
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,945
Oh, come on.

262
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,480
You're looking for the
Philosopher's Stone, right?

263
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,325
I don't care about the
Philosopher's Stone!

264
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,188
All I care about is returning my little
brother to the body he was born with!

265
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,756
But he's far better off staying
in the body he's got now.

266
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,016
What the hell do you know?

267
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,785
Not everyone's like you!

268
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:16,005
I didn't come here to negotiate.

269
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:22,145
If all you Homunculi are mistakes created
by Alchemists, the results of their sins,

270
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:26,625
well, then an Alchemist should be
responsible for correcting those mistakes,

271
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,845
starting right now!

272
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,505
Huh.

273
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,905
All right.

274
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,625
I didn't want to have to show
you this since it does get a bit ugly.

275
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,125
But since you're getting all serious
on me, then I'll get serious too.

276
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:44,905
What the.....

277
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,835
This is my real form.

278
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,275
Come and get it!

279
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:05,355
Didn't even hurt.

280
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,395
You're lying!

281
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:10,495
My body's structure and
composition are completely unaltered.

282
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,415
So you are the ultimate shield.

283
00:20:13,495 --> 00:20:16,135
You've never killed
anyone, have you, kid?

284
00:20:16,630 --> 00:20:18,346
What's that got to do with it?

285
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:20,915
I'm saying you
lack the guts to kill.

286
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,806
You'll never beat me like that.

287
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,175
And you'll never beat
the other Homunculi either.

288
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,810
So I'll help you
find the guts now.

289
00:20:27,811 --> 00:20:31,275
By showing you some of your own.

290
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:37,635
Damn it!

291
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:43,575
Hey.

292
00:20:44,690 --> 00:20:45,506
Greed!

293
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,615
The military!

294
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:47,455
They're here!

295
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,855
So what now?

296
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,226
Well, damn it.

297
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,715
Those bastards went
and ruined our fight.

298
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,870
Well, hell, boss.

299
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,306
Don't sound worried or anything.

300
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,935
Play it cool.

301
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,795
There's no one in the military
who can do us any harm.

302
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,755
Kimbley?

303
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:22,126
Bastard.

304
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,795
You've betrayed us, haven't you?

305
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,625
It's time to move.

306
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,685
Greed, let's go.

307
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:31,696
No!

308
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,265
Wait!

309
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,876
See ya, kid.

310
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,705
It's been fun.

311
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,585
You're not going anywhere.

312
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,240
What is this?

313
00:21:40,241 --> 00:21:42,325
Please don't resist, Mr. Elric.

314
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,425
Resist?

315
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,483
What are you talking?

316
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,896
Lieutenant Commander
Archer is asking for you.

317
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,985
Please come with us.

318
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:49,956
Those criminals just ran
off with my brother again.

319
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,085
And you expect...

320
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,045
I'm afraid this is an order.

321
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,462
Fullmetal Alchemist

322
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:45,190
Episode 34 Theory of Avarice.

323
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,606
This time I have
only one goal in mind.

324
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,055
To defeat greed.

325
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,075
There are some sins
that cannot be forgiven.
