1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,690
Father, you've come home!

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:08,850
Mind your volume, please, Selim.

3
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:17,780
For you.

4
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:24,340
Go ahead and open it.

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:25,480
All right.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:30,990
Oh wow!

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,520
Thank you, Father.

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,580
It's not every day a young man turns ten,
my son.

9
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,940
Where are we?

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,980
We're at my master's house.

11
00:00:44,981 --> 00:00:45,600
What?

12
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,840
You mean the one who's forced you all to
search for the Philosopher's Stone?

13
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,520
I wouldn't say forced.

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,620
It's more like we're obliged to help in
return for the master's generosity and care.

15
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:58,360
If you think any of this is for your
benefit, you're wrong.

16
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,400
Listen, kid, you don't have to tell me
that.

17
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,640
I don't?

18
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:04,640
Of course not.

19
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,680
I'm well aware that this serves the master
and the master only.

20
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,040
But to tell you the truth, I don't really
care.

21
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,600
Just seeing all the human suffering makes
it worthwhile.

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,200
Hey, hey, you're carrying precious cargo.

23
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,340
So try not to overdo it.

24
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,620
I hate you!

25
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:33,260
Do you have any clue how many people Scar
had to kill to create the Philosopher's Stone?

26
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:38,280
Of all the soldiers that invaded Lior,
7,000 never made it home.

27
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,820
But don't fret.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,280
They're right in here.

29
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:49,740
Oh, I bet you didn't even realize all the souls of the
Ishbalans that were sealed in Scar's arm are inside you now.

30
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,380
Isn't that great?

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:58,420
So now that you're fully aware of just how
valuable you are to us, I suggest you be...have!

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,760
There's so many moments when I should have
died.

33
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,840
Time... after
time... after time...

34
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,840
But I survived.

35
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
And for what?

36
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:25,240
Why do I deserve to live when so many
others have died?

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,180
The Philosopher's Stone.

38
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:34,140
Those who possess it, no longer bound by
the laws of equivalent exchange and alchemy.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,500
They gain without sacrifice, create
without equal exchange.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,920
We searched for it.

41
00:02:42,921 --> 00:02:44,960
And we found it.

42
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,139
It's Edward.

43
00:04:37,753 --> 00:04:38,893
Took you long enough.

44
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:40,157
Sorry.

45
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,677
So this is the place?

46
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:42,760
Yep, this is it.

47
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,820
Let me see that letter again, would you?

48
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,700
A number of years ago, my father wanted to
learn how to make red water.

49
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,420
So he came to Central.

50
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,300
When he got here, he managed to work his
way into a place called Laboratory Five.

51
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,500
There, he became acquainted with a certain
gifted Alchemist.

52
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:08,940
It wasn't long before this man began to
share his secrets, like how to transmute

53
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:13,565
red water into the Philosopher's Stone by
using human lives, as well as the secret

54
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:19,044
location of what was to be referred to by
insiders as the True Laboratory.

55
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:23,426
From the sound of his note, it seems like
we've just scratched the surface.

56
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,900
Secret as Lab Five was, it's still a front
for something deeper.

57
00:05:27,652 --> 00:05:30,808
And there's no time like the present to
find out if he was telling the truth.

58
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:33,740
I'm going alone.

59
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,260
But if Al's in danger down there, maybe
we can use our alchemy to help you save him.

60
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Oh, don't worry.

61
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm gonna get him out of there alive,
no matter what.

62
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:48,761
Edward.

63
00:05:49,428 --> 00:05:49,794
Huh?

64
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,523
I just want to be clear about something.

65
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,710
I didn't tell you all this so you could
create the Stone.

66
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,550
Trust me, Russell.

67
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,090
That's the last thing I would ever plan on
doing.

68
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:02,716
Not anymore.

69
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,673
Just come back.

70
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:18,526
JUST COME BACK ALIVE!

71
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,070
According to my father's writings,
if you enter this hidden temple and

72
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:39,750
journey far below Central, you'll find a
city buried beneath it.

73
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:46,430
Not long after Father arrived,
he began to hear bizarre rumors about a

74
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,143
city that once stood where Central stands
today.

75
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:53,730
But four centuries ago, it had somehow
mysteriously vanished in one night,

76
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,830
along with all of its inhabitants.

77
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,730
At first, Father chalked it up to local
folklore, but as he became more entrenched

78
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:06,090
in the secret happenings of Laboratory
Five, he soon found out that these.

79
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:08,995
seemingly ridiculous stories were,
in fact...

80
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:10,309
True.

81
00:07:11,805 --> 00:07:14,385
They were all sacrificed for the
Philosopher's Stone.

82
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,850
Then all evidence of their existence was
erased.

83
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:23,170
Using alchemy, the city was pulled underground,
leaving nothing behind but a rumor to fuel the curious.

84
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,050
Only monsters could come up with such a
plan.

85
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,575
Are you in here, Dad?

86
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:35,990
You did this!

87
00:07:36,477 --> 00:07:38,411
You came up with the whole plan,
didn't you?

88
00:07:39,243 --> 00:07:40,342
Tell me!!!!

89
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:48,530
No gluttony.

90
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,970
You've had lunch.

91
00:07:53,893 --> 00:07:57,253
Why must I always remind him that you're
too important to eat?

92
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,040
Exquisite.

93
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:04,180
No wonder Edward loves you so much.

94
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,000
He does, you know.

95
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:08,999
And you love him, too.

96
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,760
Will someone tell me what happened to my
lust?

97
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,900
I don't know.

98
00:08:12,901 --> 00:08:14,100
Maybe she's Lust.

99
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,760
Now we must make sure to wear our finest
dresses.

100
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,340
I want everything to be perfect for him.

101
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,920
He's here.

102
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,800
My, my.

103
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,200
Sooner than I thought.

104
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:29,541
Wrath: Where is he?
What now?

105
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:30,433
Tell me, please!

106
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,460
Get off of me!
I need the Philosopher's Stone!

107
00:08:31,461 --> 00:08:32,480
What's he doing here?

108
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,640
I clearly told you I wanted Wrath to keep
an eye on Edward.

109
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,120
Please, give it to me!

110
00:08:36,121 --> 00:08:38,340
It's not my fault he can't follow orders.

111
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,180
Please, Master, I need the Stone now!

112
00:08:40,181 --> 00:08:44,500
Wrath, if you can't behave properly,
you'll have to remain a Homunculus.

113
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,440
There's no time!

114
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,640
My mommy!

115
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,700
Mommy's gonna die!

116
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,620
Mommy?

117
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,220
I don't know.

118
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,840
I think he's talking about Sloth.

119
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,040
Don't be ridiculous.

120
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,460
Sloth isn't your mother.

121
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,400
Homunculi do not have mothers.

122
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,940
Understood?

123
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,460
Save her, please!

124
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,600
I need her!

125
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,700
You're not a human, Wrath.

126
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,940
Stop acting like one.

127
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,600
Mommy!

128
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,320
Mommy!

129
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:03,920
Mommy!

130
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,480
Mommy!

131
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:05,920
Envy?

132
00:09:09,821 --> 00:09:10,220
Please!

133
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,760
Don't even think about it.

134
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Now come here.

135
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,140
No wonder that Elric brat enjoys using his
Automail so much.

136
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,100
The amount of power it supplies is
absolutely exhilarating.

137
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:39,997
That's precisely why I hate the military.

138
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:42,680
Because of power-hungry, blood-sucking
filth like you.

139
00:09:43,131 --> 00:09:44,211
For the last time.

140
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:46,968
Give up this
foolishness and join me and my men.

141
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:52,984
We will soon be waging a war in all
directions, ushering in a new era of domination.

142
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,400
You can still be a part of it.

143
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,420
I'd rather rot in hell.

144
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,780
Permission granted.

145
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,150
Your students will soon follow.

146
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:14,810
You fools!

147
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:15,690
I'm your superior!

148
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,810
You'll regret this!

149
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,370
Izumi!

150
00:10:21,874 --> 00:10:22,274
Edward.

151
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:28,813
Ed must be the temple now.

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,460
Don't tell me you've risked your careers.

153
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,360
On the word of kids.

154
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,180
Those children hold the state's future.

155
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,200
It's our duty to enable them.

156
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,100
At least that's what Hughes used to say.

157
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:18,338
Rose..

158
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:24,864
Edward.

159
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,490
I've been waiting for you.

160
00:11:31,742 --> 00:11:37,190
Honestly, Din, how many times do I have
to tell you crawfish aren't for you to play with?

161
00:11:39,149 --> 00:11:42,189
Why do you insist on always learning
things the hard way?

162
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:44,543
Is something wrong?

163
00:11:45,675 --> 00:11:46,530
Not really.

164
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,250
I just realized something.

165
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,150
What is it?

166
00:11:51,590 --> 00:11:56,370
Before Hughes died, he always used to say
that nothing is ever completely negative.

167
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,850
At the time, I wasn't sure what he meant.

168
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:00,730
But you're sure now?

169
00:12:01,529 --> 00:12:07,209
I used to believe the Homunculi were evil because they
did unspeakable things just to find the Philosopher's Stone.

170
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:09,650
But I'm starting to think maybe I was
wrong.

171
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,790
We've seen what humans do with power.

172
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:17,790
We might use the stone as a weapon and create
tragedies even worse than the Homunculi have.

173
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,157
But they take it away right after
it's made and destroy anyone

174
00:12:21,197 --> 00:12:24,310
who is near it, starting rumors
of danger about the stone.

175
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:28,524
So this rumor makes people think... You're
a little too scared to go searching for it, right?

176
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,770
But do you realize what I'm saying,
Winry?

177
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:33,910
Those monsters might actually be doing
mankind a favor!

178
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:36,576
Maybe not.

179
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,470
Sometimes danger can add an element of
excitement.

180
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:42,250
And that could make people want to go
after it even more.

181
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:47,710
So, do you think Ed and Al are all right?

182
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,430
Of course they are, silly.

183
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,390
There's not a doubt in my mind.

184
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:54,510
You know, Winry?

185
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,870
You make a good point.

186
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,010
But for humanity's sake, I hope you're
wrong.

187
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:06,840
Uh, Rose?

188
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,200
What are you doing here?

189
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,780
I've been waiting.

190
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,740
For you.

191
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,900
For us.

192
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,700
Edward, I love you.

193
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:16,319
You do?

194
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:22,635
Look, Rose, I don't think you realize what
you just said to me.

195
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,800
We're just friends.

196
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,200
My baby.

197
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:35,859
My baby.

198
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,350
You couldn't give her one little dance?

199
00:13:38,853 --> 00:13:42,329
Seeing as how she's been waiting here for
you ever since she came into hiding.

200
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,730
You're despicable.

201
00:13:44,828 --> 00:13:45,394
Lyra

202
00:13:45,607 --> 00:13:47,501
why'd you bring Rose to this place?

203
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,810
Before Dante died, she told me about a
city that only old Alchemists knew about.

204
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:52,930
It sounded safe.

205
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:56,636
I know you said before that Dante had been
murdered, but you were awfully vague.

206
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,410
You never told me who did it or why.

207
00:13:58,895 --> 00:14:00,470
That Homunculus named Greed killed her.

208
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:02,470
I could have sworn I told you that.

209
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,230
You're lying to me.

210
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,150
Am I?

211
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:11,246
The transmutation circle in Dante's mansion was
designed specifically to drain a Homunculi's power.

212
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,370
And the human remains that were Greed's
weakness were laid out in the same room.

213
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:19,010
Even if he wanted to, Greed couldn't have
made a move against her.

214
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,350
That's all very interesting.

215
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,710
But I saw her corpse with my own eyes.

216
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,090
That proves nothing except that the body she
was squatting in could no longer serve its purpose.

217
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:28,910
What?

218
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:33,570
Let's say the Philosopher's Stone could be
used to jump from one body to another.

219
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:36,850
That would make a human capable of living
for hundreds of years.

220
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,010
I think Dante faked her death and used the
stone to take over a younger body.

221
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,570
A body like yours would be just the right
fit.

222
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,190
Edward, stop it!

223
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,290
It's not true!

224
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,253
That was too close.

225
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:58,460
When did you see the gate?

226
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,120
That's the only way you could transmute
without a circle.

227
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:03,299
And Lyra couldn't do that before.

228
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:06,004
Your secret's up, Dante.

229
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,040
When did you find out, fair son of
Hohenheim?

230
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,280
So it's all true.

231
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,360
Indeed.

232
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,140
Every last word.

233
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,580
So how many times have you jumped bodies?

234
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,560
Well, in four hundred years you can lose
count.

235
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,140
It's less than ten.

236
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:25,000
After all, I had to use the Philosopher's
Stone each time.

237
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,440
And that's what happened to this city.

238
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,240
Lives for the stone.

239
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,440
Don't forget the fabled Lust civilization
in the East.

240
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
It was the same.

241
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,100
But I'm not the one who made it happen.

242
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,820
No, it was Hohenheim of Light.

243
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,720
You say it so formally.

244
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,980
Why don't you just call him Dad?

245
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,600
Did he live this way too?

246
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,360
Stealing bodies, creating wars?

247
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,920
And for what purpose?

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,980
Because we were worth it.

249
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,940
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

250
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,980
You ruined thousands of lives to create
each Philosopher's Stone.

251
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,040
Then you take it for yourself so you can
live longer.

252
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,100
And you actually think that's justified?

253
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,420
Humans can't handle the stone.

254
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:02,900
Right.

255
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,060
So you have the mercy to take it from
them.

256
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,540
The grace to kill anyone who was involved.

257
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:10,900
So only the legend remains.

258
00:16:11,045 --> 00:16:13,261
I'm glad you understand so well.

259
00:16:13,419 --> 00:16:15,719
Humans are controlled by their sins.

260
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:20,517
And the Philosopher's Stone has power far
greater than any weapon ever forged.

261
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:22,230
So I've taken cities.

262
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,600
Humans would destroy the world.

263
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,320
The lives Lust have been necessary
martyrs, saving mankind from itself.

264
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,900
I am the Guardian.

265
00:16:30,901 --> 00:16:32,580
The Shepherd of Sins.

266
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,800
I have to live on to prevent you humans
from doing something foolish with the stone.

267
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,726
Don't kid yourself!

268
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,280
You're a human just like us!

269
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,776
Not anymore.

270
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:44,680
Lust!

271
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,580
Lust!

272
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Where are you?

273
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,620
You're breaking my heart, Edward.

274
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,280
Talking to me this way.

275
00:16:52,723 --> 00:16:57,060
I was looking forward to taking her body
and being loved by the son of Hohenheim.

276
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,040
So it's Rose this time, huh?

277
00:16:59,260 --> 00:16:59,820
Yes.

278
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,540
I have to celebrate the newly born stone.

279
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,680
What have you done with Al?

280
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,620
No, no!

281
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,360
What have you done with Lust?

282
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Why don't you ask him, gluttony?

283
00:17:11,479 --> 00:17:12,799
Where's my Lust?

284
00:17:15,282 --> 00:17:16,462
Where's Lust?

285
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:19,880
Look I'm sorry, but she's gone.

286
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,960
Not gone?

287
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,460
Not gone?

288
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:23,680
Yeah.

289
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,340
Wrath killed her.

290
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,400
She died trying to help me.

291
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:35,450
Gluttony, stop this.

292
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:36,890
I can't.

293
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,730
You don't have feelings.

294
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:42,750
Lust.

295
00:17:45,154 --> 00:17:45,525
Lust.

296
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,450
Let's do it!

297
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:01,828
I knew it.

298
00:18:02,562 --> 00:18:04,570
Your soul can't sustain bodies anymore.

299
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:06,370
It's been attached too many times.

300
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,483
Equivalent exchange.

301
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:11,150
Every time you jump, you lose part of
yourself.

302
00:18:11,981 --> 00:18:12,850
Equivalence?

303
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,910
Don't tell me you still believe in that
naive theory.

304
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,070
It's no theory.

305
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,930
It's the absolute law of alchemy.

306
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,530
No, of the whole world.

307
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,410
To obtain anything, something of equal
value must be Lost.

308
00:18:24,995 --> 00:18:27,090
You couldn't have gotten anywhere without
knowing that.

309
00:18:27,615 --> 00:18:28,770
A beautiful story.

310
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:32,590
Told to comfort the oppressed and make
children do their lessons.

311
00:18:33,883 --> 00:18:37,423
The truth is, the law of equivalent
exchange is a lie.

312
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,010
Impossible!

313
00:18:38,698 --> 00:18:41,151
To gain something of equal value must be
Lost.

314
00:18:41,864 --> 00:18:46,050
Conversely, if you give something up, you
will always gain a prize of equal worth in return.

315
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:46,709
Exactly.

316
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,338
That's why people work hard at anything
they do.

317
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,290
Because it pays off.

318
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:50,970
Wrong.

319
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,630
People work because they believe it will
pay.

320
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:57,330
But equal effort does not always mean
equal gain.

321
00:18:58,423 --> 00:18:59,363
Like what?

322
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:03,750
Consider the state alchemy exam which you
passed with flying colors.

323
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,270
How many others took the test that day?

324
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:08,330
Spent months, years preparing.

325
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,710
Some working much harder than you.

326
00:19:11,242 --> 00:19:12,970
Yet you were the only one who passed.

327
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:14,870
Where was their reward?

328
00:19:14,871 --> 00:19:18,230
Is it their fault they lacked your natural
talent?

329
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:22,210
Or what about the equal value of each
person's life?

330
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,885
If I just clap my hands, this baby won't
survive.

331
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,550
Stop it!

332
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,390
And if I do it, where is the world's
balance in that?

333
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:40,146
Does it mean the baby was only born so
that it could die?

334
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,230
It's doing all an infant can to survive.

335
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,170
Breathing, crying for help.

336
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,970
But what does it get in exchange?

337
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:50,710
People can say there is a balance, a
logic that everything happens for a reason.

338
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,070
But the truth is far less designed.

339
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,910
No matter how hard you work, when you die,
you die.

340
00:19:57,409 --> 00:20:02,190
Some spend their entire life trying to scratch
their way to the top and still die in poverty.

341
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:05,830
While others are born into wealth without
ever working at all.

342
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:10,230
It's a cruel and random world,
and yet the chaos is all so beautiful.

343
00:20:10,649 --> 00:20:11,989
That's enough, Dante!

344
00:20:18,456 --> 00:20:19,088
My baby!

345
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:25,870
Equivalent exchange is a myth, a contrived
order to give sense to a world that has none.

346
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:29,683
Can you accept that now, or do you need
another demonstration?

347
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,995
Don't use a child to fuel your agenda!

348
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,430
Your dad said that too.

349
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:49,866
Hello?

350
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:51,900
Where am I?

351
00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,900
Oh, my head feels like it's been put
through a...

352
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:57,019
What?

353
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:07,740
Okay...

354
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,120
That's odd.

355
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,820
Are those sirens?

356
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,020
Edward, quick!

357
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,220
It's an air raid.

358
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:15,673
We have to go now.

359
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,040
Come on!

360
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,580
Wait!

361
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,940
What the hell's going on here,
old man?

362
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:25,900
What is this place?

363
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,620
Where are we?

364
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,120
Wait, what?

365
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:30,600
Edward, you're not sounding like yourself.

366
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:33,060
Funny, I don't really feel like myself
either.

367
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,620
And what is this city?

368
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,580
What's happened to my body?

369
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,920
Did Dante do this?

370
00:21:42,284 --> 00:21:42,960
Transmute.

371
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,480
Does that word mean anything to you?

372
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,240
Of course it does!

373
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,680
But how did you get here?

374
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,040
Yeah, good question!

375
00:21:52,906 --> 00:21:54,066
We'll talk later.

376
00:21:55,893 --> 00:21:56,913
What's attacking?

377
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,140
Zeppelins!

378
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,626
Zepp-what?!

379
00:23:39,227 --> 00:23:40,733
Fullmetal Alchemist

380
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:43,510
Episode 50.
Death.
