1
00:00:08,163 --> 00:00:09,163
It's so cruel.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,694
If the Devil really does interfere in
this world, we've seen his work tonight.

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,370
The Devil's work, huh?

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,510
We state alchemists are human
artillery they roll out if nothing else works.

5
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:25,390
And when the military calls, it's our duty to
respond regardless of how grotesque the scenario.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:29,470
To serve, we have to distance
ourselves from emotional attachments.

7
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,830
In that way, we're not
so different from Tucker.

8
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:36,270
With respect, that's the
reasoning of an adult.

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,170
But those children
are still just...

10
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,330
Brother.

11
00:00:44,331 --> 00:00:45,510
Brother, the Major.

12
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,950
There's no use, kid.

13
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:54,890
You can't go around trying to bring every living
creature that dies on you back to life, Edward.

14
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:57,010
It's not possible
and it's not healthy.

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,290
Anyway, who'd you be helping by
bringing back a malformed chimera?

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,090
It's an ugly world out there.

17
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:07,770
And from here on out, it's only gonna
get uglier on the path you've chosen.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,710
Just be thankful it wasn't
you and get on with your life.

19
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,930
Get on with my life?!

20
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:17,030
There's a reason you became
a state alchemist, right, Ed?

21
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,650
Can you really afford to get
distracted by every little lost cause?

22
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,010
Great.

23
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,990
Well, so much for making it home
in time to kiss my little girl goodnight.

24
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:28,830
Crime scene's over here.

25
00:01:28,831 --> 00:01:31,610
It's up to the investigations
department now.

26
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:32,650
Step aside.

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,780
We've got some
kind of mess here.

28
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,720
Is this the work of that serial
killer we've been tracking, Mustang?

29
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,700
No, that guy only
goes for women.

30
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,580
Besides, this thing
wasn't carved up.

31
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,320
Right.

32
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:55,860
I'd say it was almost as if that poor pathetic
creature were blown apart from the inside.

33
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,500
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

34
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,200
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

35
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,660
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

36
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,100
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

37
00:04:02,064 --> 00:04:06,324
Fullmetal Alchemist, Episode
8: The Philosopher's Stone

38
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,640
Why so glum, Elric?

39
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,560
This job's a little more
real than I bargained on.

40
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,080
I think I just need something to
take my mind off this whole mess.

41
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:26,320
So, uh, what's this
assignment you've got for me?

42
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,443
There you go.

43
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Your orders are to go through
and organize all of this stuff.

44
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,519
You should familiarize yourself with
all the results of Tucker's experiments.

45
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,100
So you want me to take
over that maniac's research?

46
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,300
True, he might have gone about it the
wrong way, but some of his findings could

47
00:04:48,301 --> 00:04:49,660
be of great use to the military.

48
00:04:49,661 --> 00:04:52,080
Why don't you let that
whack-job help you himself?

49
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,720
He can't.

50
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,520
He's dead.

51
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,360
His guilt was so obvious that the higher
-ups decided to forego the embarrassment

52
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:02,420
of a trial and skip
straight to the execution.

53
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,700
So they covered it up!

54
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,880
How could they--

55
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,680
We don't question the
wisdom of the military.

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,700
See, that's the first law
of state alchemy, Ed.

57
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,380
Interesting.

58
00:05:22,381 --> 00:05:27,000
It looks like Mr. Tucker was doing a lot
of research on the Philosopher's Stone.

59
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,300
Whoop-dee-flippin'-do.

60
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
How long are you planning
to sulk like this, brother?

61
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,980
Do you have any idea the power the
Philosopher's Stone holds for alchemists?

62
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,860
We could bypass all the laws of
alchemy, including equivalent exchange!

63
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,240
We could do the things
we weren't able to do before.

64
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,960
We could... We can't do
anything because it doesn't exist!

65
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,000
It's just a bedtime story!

66
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:55,020
But if the bonafide state alchemist like
Mr. Tucker was doing research on it...

67
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,680
Who gives a damn
about his research?

68
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,020
The man was a lunatic!

69
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,780
Or have you
forgotten about Nina?

70
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,270
It's a no-go, kid.

71
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,610
But why not?

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,350
What if that serial killer you guys
have been chasing really did kill Nina?

73
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:15,310
I could help you find him!

74
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,370
And the job that you
were ordered to do?

75
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:19,990
Have you finished
analyzing Tucker's research?

76
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,790
I couldn't do that.

77
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,430
In that case, I'll
investigate on my own.

78
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:26,870
Right.

79
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:27,890
Investigate on your own.

80
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,230
And leave that here.

81
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,890
Yeah, I intended to.

82
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,680
Brother?

83
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,540
Hold on, Ed.

84
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,060
You're not the only
one who's upset.

85
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,800
We couldn't do
anything for Nina.

86
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,400
But we're
alchemists, not police.

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,780
We can't catch a killer.

88
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,100
What we can do is put our
talents to better use doing research.

89
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,680
So that if another girl like Nina ever
comes along, we'll know how to save...

90
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,520
...her.

91
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,090
It's you.

92
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,330
You were outside the library.

93
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,840
Tell me, if you've got access to the library in
Central, then that must make you a state alchemist.

94
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,560
Well, I was, yeah.

95
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,680
But that's all behind me now.

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Really?

97
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,280
You're better off.

98
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:36,110
Because if you were still a state
alchemist, this arm would destroy you.

99
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,550
I can't wait to see
Ed and Al's faces.

100
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:51,643
They'd never expect me to travel all
the way here just to congratulate them.

101
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,263
Surprise!

102
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:56,470
Have you ever seen it?

103
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,890
What can you tell me about it?

104
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,090
Not too much.

105
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,850
I'm afraid I've never heard anything
substantial about the Philosopher's Stone.

106
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,330
Well, about it actually
existing, anyway.

107
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,870
As far as I know,
it's just a legend.

108
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:09,590
I see.

109
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,510
But I can say, if you know what's best
for you, you'll find another hobby to pursue.

110
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:21,390
It's been said that bad things have a way of
happening to those who seek the Philosopher's Stone.

111
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:23,450
Did someone say
something about the Stone?

112
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,510
Who is this guy?

113
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:29,610
Are you kidding?

114
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,670
This guy is--

115
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:35,230
So, you'd like to get your hands
on the Stone, is that right, son?

116
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:36,190
Yes, sir.

117
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,410
And why do you want it?

118
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:39,910
For human trans--

119
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,630
I mean, I need it to recover
something important that my brother lost.

120
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:45,930
Is that so?

121
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,770
This brother of yours
must be very special to you.

122
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,090
It's some undertaking.

123
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,510
The crusade you're embarking
on is as old as alchemy itself.

124
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,090
Personally, I try
to stay above it.

125
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,010
But from time to time, you'll hear about some
alchemist who's succeeded in forging a Stone.

126
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,510
Such rumors naturally have a way of
congregating around military personnel.

127
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:10,810
So there should be plenty of records on
the subject down at the National Library.

128
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,790
Is that true?

129
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,490
Most assuredly.

130
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,450
Of course, only state
alchemists have access to it.

131
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,410
So what you're saying is, any state
alchemist could find out more about this thing?

132
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,930
Uh, excuse me.

133
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:33,730
With all due respect, sir, why would you
encourage him to chase a futile pursuit like that?

134
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,270
Hmph.

135
00:09:35,271 --> 00:09:38,470
I think it's a good thing for
youngsters to have dreams to follow.

136
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:41,170
Don't you agree with
me, second lieutenant?

137
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:43,290
Yes, sir.

138
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,150
You see, I'm right!

139
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:50,730
You think she's just
too cute, don't you?

140
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,310
Uh, yeah, that's it.

141
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,190
You got me.

142
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,560
What do you think?

143
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
I know it.

144
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:04,100
You're thinking she
takes after me, right?

145
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,520
Well, the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

146
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,180
Yeah.

147
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,100
I've seen that same
picture a dozen times!

148
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,560
Now there's no need
for that attitude, is there?

149
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,860
Not when I've shared classified
files on the serial killer with you.

150
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,960
Yeah, and you owe me for the
train and delivering your baby.

151
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:19,920
So what else you got?

152
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,600
Touché, touché.

153
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,740
Well, anyway, the
investigation's at a standstill.

154
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,540
We've got no clues and
no witnesses to go on.

155
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,260
The bodies are all sliced and diced,
but none of us can figure out how he does

156
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:32,340
it in such a short time.

157
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,100
Maybe he killed them somewhere
else and then moved the bodies later.

158
00:10:36,101 --> 00:10:38,660
How long between the time of
death and when they were found?

159
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,640
We've come a long way, but even
with modern science, we can't figure that.

160
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,442
But between us and the police, we must
have checked the trunks of every single.

161
00:10:46,443 --> 00:10:47,000
..

162
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,980
...car entering
and exiting the city.

163
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,420
There must be some sort of
blind spot you're missing here.

164
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,360
A car that can hide bodies, or a... Or
maybe it's all been the work of an alchemist.

165
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,180
Alchemists are not
cold-blooded murderers!

166
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,100
[Laughter]

167
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,000
Excuse me, sir.

168
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,260
Are you Edward Elric?

169
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,660
Who's asking?

170
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,360
There's a visitor
here to see you.

171
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,240
Waiting out front.

172
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,660
A visitor?

173
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,480
Hey.

174
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,820
If it isn't our
prettiest delivery girl.

175
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,640
Behave yourself.

176
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,740
So they held the certification
exams recently, right?

177
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,200
Yes, ma'am.

178
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,540
And did you hear it?

179
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:32,740
This time, some 12-year-old alchemist
actually made the cut, if you can believe it.

180
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,560
All he has to do is... this.

181
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
And just like that,
he can transmute.

182
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,320
Very impressive indeed.

183
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,520
Right there.

184
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,120
He's the short
one in the red coat.

185
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,240
Look at him.

186
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,240
He's just a little kid.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,020
By the way, I want you to be extra
careful out there with that freak on the loose.

188
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:50,760
They say he goes for the
young pretty ones like you.

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,640
How sweet.

190
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,700
It's nice to hear
you think I'm pretty.

191
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,540
Well, yeah.

192
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,760
I sure hope they
catch this creep soon.

193
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
You and me both.

194
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:03,043
So, working around here, you must get
all the inside scoop on this case, right?

195
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,240
Isn't that just like Ed to
keep me waiting forever?

196
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,550
That's one of those
new refrigerated trucks!

197
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:24,390
I've read all about these, but I've
never seen one up close before.

198
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,490
So cool.

199
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,570
I'd sure love to take it apart.

200
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,350
I'm afraid that would
make it a bit hard to drive.

201
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,310
Oh, I'm sorry.

202
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,750
Is this your truck?

203
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:35,530
Sure is.

204
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,870
I, uh, use it to
make deliveries.

205
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,470
It really is amazing!

206
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,530
Would you like to
take a look inside?

207
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:48,330
Really?

208
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,210
Can I?

209
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,710
Thank you so much!

210
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,270
That's odd.

211
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,250
I told her to wait right here.

212
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:02,890
I wonder where she
could have wandered off to.

213
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:04,830
What's up, Mr. Elric?

214
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,860
Is this...

215
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,020
Winry?

216
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:27,540
Was there a car stopped
here when you left her?

217
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,500
Well, yeah.

218
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
There's always refrigerated trucks parked
here when they drop off food for the mess hall.

219
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,080
Refrigerated trucks?

220
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,400
A car that can hide bodies?

221
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,480
Oh, no!

222
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,920
Where are you going, Mr. Elric?

223
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:03,190
Hey, miss.

224
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:03,910
Are you alright?

225
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:07,790
Have you seen
others like you in here?

226
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,530
Over there.

227
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,090
A young girl.

228
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,550
Okay, I'll just go grab her and
we can get the hell out of this place.

229
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,330
Don't worry, ma'am.

230
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,510
You're in safe hands now--

231
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,040
My hero awakes.

232
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,280
Why, you...

233
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:41,480
Word on the playground is you can
transmute without a circle just using your hands.

234
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,340
So to be safe.

235
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,980
Please, let me introduce myself.

236
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,660
My name is Barry, and
this here is my butcher shop.

237
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,000
You're a man!

238
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,960
Guilty as charged.

239
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,700
And to reward you for making it
this far, we have a special guest.

240
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,900
Let her go!

241
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,140
Since she enjoys taking things
apart, I thought I'd do the same to her.

242
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,540
If you watch us carefully, you just
might get to see what makes her tick.

243
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,800
You sick--!

244
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,740
Why are you doing this?

245
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,540
Why?

246
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:21,700
Huh.

247
00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:24,680
What a strange
little question that is.

248
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:29,020
I suppose it's
because I enjoy it.

249
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,280
The first person I
killed was my wife.

250
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:37,040
She was nagging me about something, and
then without meaning to, I chopped her to pieces.

251
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,460
But when I saw how finely I
could slice her, I wanted more.

252
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,360
More people to cut up, to reduce
to their most basic building blocks.

253
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,620
And I wanted everyone to see.

254
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:50,180
How could a person murder
someone for such a ridiculous reason?

255
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,780
Because they can.

256
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:56,480
Given the slightest
provocation, anybody can do it.

257
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,020
Stay back!

258
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,300
Men have morals, but send them to war
and they have no problem slaying each other in

259
00:16:01,301 --> 00:16:02,560
the most brutal fashions.

260
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,020
Why do you think that is?

261
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,000
I have no idea.

262
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,700
Because deep down
inside, we all want to kill.

263
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,140
Most just need the
go-ahead from their society.

264
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:17,080
Like the state alchemists I saw in a
village, slaughtering helpless people.

265
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:19,160
Splat big fountains of blood.

266
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,100
That's not true.

267
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,060
No!

268
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,380
You little--!

269
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,030
Damn it!

270
00:17:54,113 --> 00:17:55,339
Don't!

271
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,720
It'll take more than
that to kill me, Brother.

272
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,300
Hey!

273
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,380
They're all in here!

274
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,560
Don't move!

275
00:18:10,774 --> 00:18:11,294
Al...

276
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,140
I--

277
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,560
Brother, are you hurt?

278
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,560
I thought he was gonna kill me.

279
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,300
I honestly thought
I was gonna die.

280
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,160
I was so scared.

281
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
So scared!

282
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:39,070
Major Hughes was the one who realized
the truck from this particular shop had

283
00:18:39,071 --> 00:18:40,890
bypassed numerous
inspection points.

284
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:43,670
Thanks to him, we
managed to get there in time.

285
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,410
Afterwards, the case of Barry
the Chopper became infamous.

286
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:53,070
And it would be spoken of as
Ed's first distinguished achievement.

287
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:56,420
But he would
remember it differently.

288
00:18:58,923 --> 00:18:59,533
Brother?

289
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:03,930
It turns out the Philosopher's
Stone may very well be real.

290
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,990
But all the clues we need to find it are
off-limits to everyone except state alchemists.

291
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:16,970
Since I no longer have a mortal shell,
I can't feel the terror you felt thinking

292
00:19:16,971 --> 00:19:18,050
you were going to die.

293
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:21,670
I'm sure it must have
been painful and lonely.

294
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,490
I want my body back, brother.

295
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:27,310
I want to be able
to feel what you felt.

296
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:28,950
To feel human again.

297
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,950
If we find the Philosopher's
Stone, I can have that.

298
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:35,930
And we can repair
what we've broken.

299
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,130
When I was certain that he was
going to kill me, my mind went blank.

300
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,810
And I didn't have
any hope anymore.

301
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,090
The only thing I could do
was scream my lungs out.

302
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,770
I felt so helpless.

303
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,690
I couldn't even bring myself to
believe someone might save me.

304
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,770
Then you showed up, Al.

305
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:59,230
And I realized if we don't take
care of each other, no one else will.

306
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,590
So I'll do anything in my
power to get our bodies back.

307
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,350
Even if it means being
the military's lab dog.

308
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:11,470
And we'll just have to hope our powers are
good enough to help us rise above our own limits.

309
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,210
Because we're not gods.

310
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,490
We're humans.

311
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:18,650
Tiny, insignificant humans.

312
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:21,530
Who couldn't even
save a little girl...

313
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:27,570
On one condition, you say?

314
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,190
I'll obey all your orders, sir.

315
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:34,290
But as long as I serve, I'd like to receive
all information on the Philosopher's Stone.

316
00:20:35,730 --> 00:20:40,310
And then whenever I've finished all my other
duties, you have to permit me to search for it.

317
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,690
People will question
your motives.

318
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,430
You realize what'll happen if the state
learns about your human transmutation.

319
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,690
Al will be hauled off to some
lab as a precious sample.

320
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,090
Well, I can keep that in my back
pocket to make sure you behave.

321
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:57,530
Fine.

322
00:20:57,750 --> 00:21:01,030
But you'll report to me everything you
uncover about the Philosopher's Stone.

323
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,210
Oh, and I almost forgot.

324
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,350
You've been issued your
official state title by the Fuhrer.

325
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,750
It's quite ironic, actually.

326
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:11,310
He's got a good sense of humor.

327
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,460
We give the name Fullmetal
to thee, Edward Elric.

328
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,460
In the name of
Fuhrer-King Bradley.

329
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,190
Along with the pocket watch, every one
of us is assigned a symbolic second name,

330
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,730
depending on your talents.

331
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,130
And yours is "Fullmetal".

332
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,790
The Fullmetal Alchemist.

333
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,570
Sounds heavy.

334
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,270
Tell him I like the feel of it.

335
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,910
I won't let it weigh me down.

336
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,730
To celebrate, you're going to buy me all
kinds of neat things I can't get back home, right?

337
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,810
I think you've got
it backwards there.

338
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,290
I forget.

339
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,970
Who fixed up your arm?

340
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,390
I heard that serial killer had
nothing to do with Nina's death.

341
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,710
Is that true, Brother?

342
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,710
Yeah, it didn't fit his pattern.

343
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:11,390
And he had an alibi that night.

344
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:14,610
So if he didn't kill
Nina... who did?

345
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,517
Fullmetal Alchemist.

346
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:41,583
Episode 9.

347
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,070
Be Thou for the People.

348
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,310
From the very beginning, I knew what it
would mean to become a state alchemist.

349
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:50,670
I only hope I made
the right choice, Al.
