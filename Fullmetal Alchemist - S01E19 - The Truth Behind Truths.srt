1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,630
A simple rock, red as blood, which
promised to turn pain into delight,

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,730
war into victory,
and death into life.

3
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,330
It was a thinking person's
dream, reason conquering all.

4
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,790
And it was in deference to this that
it was called the Philosopher's Stone.

5
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:36,640
How could this be possible?

6
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,620
I don't know.

7
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:44,320
After all this time, years of searching,
sacrificing, and this is the answer we get?

8
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,320
The secret ingredient to make a Philosopher's
Stone the only way to make it work?

9
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,920
Live humans and in mass numbers?

10
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,980
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

11
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,680
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,160
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

13
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,640
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

14
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,310
Major, please!

15
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,470
Will you wait a minute?

16
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,170
Major Armstrong!

17
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,310
It's just the boys
seem exhausted, sir.

18
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,746
They've had a long day.

19
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:58,526
Maybe we shouldn't
disturb them right now.

20
00:02:58,550 --> 00:02:59,526
Tired, you say?

21
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,390
Then I'll have to take them
to dinner in the mess hall.

22
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,210
Nothing like food in the
stomach to energize the mind.

23
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:08,510
No, uh, sir, actually, I think they've
already gone to sleep for the night.

24
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:11,890
Why don't I just tell them that you came
by when they wake up in the morning?

25
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,450
Very well, Lieutenant.

26
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,130
I guess we do want
those boys to get their rest.

27
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,926
God must really hate
people who go against him.

28
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:45,030
I was 11 years old then,
and he still has me marked.

29
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:51,930
Every time I thought I was in reach,
he's pulled it away, so I'd fall on my face.

30
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:55,843
And then, when I finally
got my fist around it, he

31
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:59,110
raises his big, obnoxious
foot and kicks me in the teeth.

32
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,706
Just face it, Al.

33
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,030
It's gonna be this
way our whole lives.

34
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:08,990
Don't say that.

35
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,410
I really thought it was
gonna work out, brother.

36
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,610
We would find the Philosopher's
Stone and it would all be okay.

37
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:18,110
It still will be.

38
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,790
We'll find the Stone, brother.

39
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,826
We will.

40
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:23,010
And we'll get our
bodies back to normal.

41
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:24,290
And be happy.

42
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:26,490
People say you're
a dog of the military.

43
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,830
That you sold your
soul to get this far.

44
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,270
But that isn't true.

45
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:31,970
And it didn't stop us.

46
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,530
And this won't either.

47
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,290
We've worked too hard.

48
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,620
Brother?

49
00:04:57,221 --> 00:04:58,640
Let's look at it again.

50
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,820
From the beginning.

51
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,100
I've looked at it enough.

52
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,220
But there's a chance
we misread something.

53
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,700
Maybe we got it wrong.

54
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,720
I said I've had enough.

55
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:09,896
But what if our code's wrong?

56
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,420
Maybe that's not what it says.

57
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,580
Or maybe we missed
some key paragraph.

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,940
Like a loophole or something.

59
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,160
We should read the
whole thing again.

60
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,560
I said enough!

61
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:35,930
Brother?

62
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,770
Is something wrong, sir?

63
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,360
It's just a broken cup.

64
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,540
Back in the hall.

65
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,740
Sorry, Al.

66
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,540
Yeah.

67
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,306
So, Ed.

68
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,750
That's really the end of it?

69
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,886
You won't regret it, then?

70
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,470
Giving up before
you're finished?

71
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,786
That's interesting.

72
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,910
I didn't realize what you were searching for
was so incidental you'd abandon it this easily.

73
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:20,510
Stop going on like you know
what you're talking about.

74
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,690
You don't know anything.

75
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,570
Wrong, Ed.

76
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,070
I know that what you boys have been
searching for is the Philosopher's Stone.

77
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,850
And I know it's created
by sacrificing human lives.

78
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,130
...

79
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,270
I know it was uncalled for, but I
was listening through the door.

80
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,730
Well, if you eavesdropped,
then you must know.

81
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,950
It's pointless to
chase after it now.

82
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,290
Leave us alone.

83
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,370
You really are a
child, aren't you?

84
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:52,990
You're frightened of it.

85
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:54,850
That all the answers
will disappear.

86
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,171
You're terrified you might have to admit
that everything you've done was wasted effort.

87
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,670
Am I wrong?

88
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:18,470
It's okay to feel lost
and not have reasons.

89
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,316
Verifying whether Marcoh's research is
the truth or not is worth something in itself,

90
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:27,480
if you ask me.

91
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,280
After all, what you're looking
for is a lot bigger than you or Al.

92
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:37,981
Why don't you try searching a little longer,
Ed, but without worries about the final result?

93
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,876
You're right.

94
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,100
It's like a book.

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,580
Just because you're mad and stop
reading doesn't change the way it ends.

96
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,380
That's right.

97
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,176
We've had roadblocks and
we've conquered them all.

98
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,820
I'll be damned if
we stop halfway.

99
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,740
We'll take this all
the way to the finish.

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,660
Let's do this, Al!

101
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,120
Right!

102
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,790
Dr. Marcoh's research is sound in theory,
but even with the inclusion of humans in

103
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:16,010
the forging process, it still never
made a perfect Philosopher's Stone.

104
00:08:16,011 --> 00:08:18,370
So there still might
be other methods.

105
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:18,986
Right.

106
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:20,790
But let's check
his method first.

107
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,510
I want to see the truth
of it with my own eyes.

108
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,210
Wait a second...

109
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,230
Truth...

110
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,570
Bottom of the page,
like an afterthought.

111
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:37,330
The genuine
truth... behind truth...

112
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,886
Of course!

113
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,750
He was saying there's
still something more!

114
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,890
According to his data, it takes huge
refining equipment to create a stone.

115
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,010
You'd need a massive
facility, like a whole complex!

116
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:53,990
Well, there are currently four alchemic
laboratories running under the military's watch.

117
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,230
They're all pretty big.

118
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,670
I know Dr. Marcoh was
assigned here, at the third lab.

119
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:03,346
No, I already went to all four labs in the city
and there wasn't anything remarkable going on.

120
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,410
Just a lot of
fast-talking bureaucrats.

121
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,270
Hey, what about this?

122
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,166
Oh, right.

123
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,210
There used to be a fifth lab,
but they closed it down years ago.

124
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,990
It's just an abandoned
building now.

125
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:17,610
Apparently there were structural
problems, so they made it off-limits.

126
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,030
That's it.

127
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:20,726
Look.

128
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,690
There's a prison
right next door.

129
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,730
So they had a spacious
lot of federal land.

130
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,190
What are you getting at?

131
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,830
If people are the key ingredient in a
philosopher's stone, doesn't it make sense

132
00:09:30,831 --> 00:09:34,030
to put a lab in a place with a
convenient state-controlled supply?

133
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,186
You don't mean
they use the convicts?

134
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:37,766
Why not?

135
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,390
You couldn't have
a cleaner plan.

136
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,650
Take condemned prisoners, say they're
executed, then use them for experiments.

137
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:44,530
Who was running this laboratory?

138
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,786
Lab 5.

139
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:49,690
That would be
Brigadier General Grand.

140
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:52,430
And he was killed by Scar,
as you're obviously aware.

141
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:56,870
What do you think?

142
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,390
There's no choice.

143
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,166
What do you say we go
check it out ourselves, Al?

144
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:01,566
Sure.

145
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,150
Now just hold on a minute.

146
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,610
From here out, this
is grown-ups' work.

147
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,450
Besides, as long as Scar is
loose, you're a walking target.

148
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,830
You can't afford to
stroll around Central.

149
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:11,606
Yeah?

150
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,626
So what?

151
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,750
Let Bloch and me be
your eyes on the ground.

152
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:17,310
We'll go to Lab 5 and see if
anything's out of the ordinary.

153
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:19,850
If we see anything,
we'll give you a full report.

154
00:10:20,850 --> 00:10:21,990
It's our duty.

155
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,090
She has a point.

156
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,276
All right.

157
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,180
I clearly can't argue with you.

158
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,320
You guys can take care of it.

159
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,620
Sir, it's the right choice.

160
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:12,770
Okay, Lieutenant Colonel.

161
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,130
I'm done writing down the
court record for case 3263.

162
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,570
Can I please go home now?

163
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,606
Great.
Glad you're done.

164
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:22,390
Yeah, you mind
holding for a minute?

165
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,246
All right, Sheska.

166
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,326
Let's keep that ball rolling.

167
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,230
Case number 9572, please.

168
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:31,030
They're going to be using that in court
tomorrow, so let's make that a rush job.

169
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:32,970
Yes, sir.

170
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,926
What's wrong?

171
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,966
You need an energy boost?

172
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,550
No!
That's not necessary!

173
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:37,946
Look!

174
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:41,270
This is the special little swimsuit
edition with Mommy's hat on!

175
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,270
Isn't she the most adorable
angel you've seen in all existence?

176
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,470
One look at her happy face
and all fatigue just flies away!

177
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,970
Doesn't it?

178
00:11:52,094 --> 00:11:52,994
yes

179
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,350
That's what I said!

180
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:55,806
She's a natural born healer!

181
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:56,946
A shaman of sunshine!

182
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,110
What's going on there?

183
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,610
So, have you found Scar's body?

184
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,190
Not yet?

185
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,446
Okay.

186
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:06,370
Well, don't forget
about the securiy.

187
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,666
for the library.

188
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,970
Send them tonight.

189
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,830
Hmm?

190
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,886
Oh.
Oh, yeah.

191
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,490
She's a real miracle worker.

192
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,110
I definitely owe Ed one
for introducing me to her.

193
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,550
Are those tripwire alarms?

194
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,206
Yep.

195
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,450
For an abandoned facility,
the security sure is tight.

196
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:43,310
It keeps getting
more suspicious.

197
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,026
Come on.

198
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,190
Let's try the back.

199
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,090
Al, boost!

200
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:55,430
Up you go!

201
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:02,230
I hate to say it, but you
can't fight convenience.

202
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,030
It's times like these I'm glad not to have
an arm and leg made of flesh and blood.

203
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,170
Same here.

204
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,030
The little barricade.

205
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,546
Yeah.

206
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,730
We'll have to find a
more creative way in.

207
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,110
Hey!
Up there!

208
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,720
Looks like it goes
all the way in.

209
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,816
All right, Al.

210
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:29,796
You wait here.

211
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,360
Will you be okay by yourself?

212
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,456
Okay or not, it's
our only choice here.

213
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,020
We're not going to get your
big metal body through this vent.

214
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,556
Sit tight.

215
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,720
I'll be back in a bit.

216
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,420
You know it's not
my fault I'm big.

217
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,400
Lieutenant Maria Ross.

218
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,440
I need to speak with
Major Armstrong, please.

219
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,860
What is it Lieutenant?

220
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,000
Sorry, sir, but there's
something I need to tell you about.

221
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,026
Hey
Contact Command!

222
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,786
Tell them we need
reinforcements!

223
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,406
ASAP!

224
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,570
Yes, sir!

225
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,230
You are not my
concern, foot soldier.

226
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,870
The Full Metal.

227
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,170
Where is he?

228
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,216
You two stay here.

229
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,240
The rest of you, move
to the other stairs.

230
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,460
He's going to Ed's room.

231
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,570
So, Full Metal, now you
understand the truth as well.

232
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,586
Scar!

233
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,750
Freeze!

234
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:36,636
Damn.

235
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,800
Lieutenant, look!

236
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,796
What about Ed and Al?

237
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,916
Where are they?

238
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,080
Here's a good clue.

239
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,260
Damn those two.

240
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,100
The town of Lior has
been handled tightly.

241
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,740
Just a harmless
spot in the sand now.

242
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,360
There's no one left who
knew anything useful.

243
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,516
Beautiful work, Envy.

244
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,136
We're glad to have
you back in our midst.

245
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,960
Things are going well here, too.

246
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,116
But what about
this runt, Full Metal?

247
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,840
I've heard he's
gotten wind of the lab.

248
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,900
Don't you think we
should take care of him?

249
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,560
Before he tells the
military our secret?

250
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,816
I'll kill them!
Let me!

251
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,976
Let me!
Please!

252
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,996
Be patient.

253
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,420
I've watched them for a long time,
and I still think they could grant our wish.

254
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:21,260
We can always kill
them after that, can't we?

255
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,281
I don't care what you do with them, Lust, as
long as they don't mess up our precious plans.

256
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,076
Although I do think it's unlikely that
they'll get past those Funhouse guards.

257
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,976
No one ever does.

258
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,600
I gave them direct orders not to lay a
hand on the boys, but that ensures nothing.

259
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,980
They are idiots, after all.

260
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,280
If it starts looking like too much
trouble, we'll have to kill them all.

261
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,520
I know that.

262
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,080
Damn it.

263
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,900
This is smaller than I thought.

264
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:51,360
See, if I was normal sized, I wouldn't have
fit, and we would have had to call this off.

265
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,760
It really is a good
thing I'm so small.

266
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,240
No, it's not!

267
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,180
Lights are still on.

268
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,720
How do they explain that when they
say they don't use this place anymore?

269
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,840
Just running up
the bill for fun?

270
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,345
The hell was that?

271
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:44,943
For them to go to all this
trouble, they must have

272
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:47,246
something here they
really don't want to be seen.

273
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,550
I'm getting excited.

274
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,490
I just love being right.

275
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:20,355
[Evil laughing]

276
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,556
At last!

277
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,060
Where are you going?

278
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,060
We're under orders not
to lay a hand on them.

279
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:26,976
Orders?

280
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,756
I don't care about orders.

281
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,100
This one's all for me.

282
00:18:30,101 --> 00:18:32,436
I'm going to drain out their marrow.

283
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:32,776
Wait.

284
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,640
There are two in our
quarry, and two of us.

285
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,440
You can't monopolize
the pleasure.

286
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,900
You know, for a lifeless ball
of rock, it sure is persistent!

287
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,060
Oh, no!

288
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,956
See?

289
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,620
And all this time I thought being
normal-sized would be a good thing.

290
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,196
Dammit!

291
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,440
Enough is enough!

292
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,010
Finally, a nice basic door.

293
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,940
Nice of you to come.

294
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,980
Graciously, do I
welcome you here.

295
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,040
You don't look too
welcoming with that sword.

296
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,140
I have been entrusted
with guarding these grounds.

297
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,980
For now, you may
call me Number Forty-eight.

298
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,536
Forty-eight.

299
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,216
Catchy.

300
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,700
It's been silent for too long.

301
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:07,880
I'm pleased to face
someone capable again.

302
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,160
But your luck has run
out running into me.

303
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,500
Do not think ill of me, child.

304
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,480
And you don't think ill of me for
being the child who defeated you.

305
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,700
How about a little
blade-on-blade?

306
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,796
It's sure taking a while.

307
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,220
What could he be doing?

308
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,760
Aaaaaah!

309
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,480
Nice.

310
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,820
You move well for a big thing.

311
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,680
Who are you?

312
00:20:36,681 --> 00:20:38,360
Oooh, so demanding.

313
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,340
I guess I should answer.

314
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:45,340
I'm Number Sixty-Six, though
that's just what they call me at work.

315
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,380
Number Sixty-Six?

316
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,296
Yes.

317
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,856
I have a proper name, too.

318
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,960
But if I told you, you'd be so
shocked you'd wet yourself.

319
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,860
I'll tell you when
I'm peeling your skin.

320
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,780
As guardian, you must
know this place pretty well.

321
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,580
I've got a question for you.

322
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,096
Defeat me.

323
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,540
Then I'll talk.

324
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,596
Hmph.

325
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,420
Now, let's see how good you are!

326
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,780
Quick!

327
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,200
Auto-mail up to the shoulder.

328
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,400
Perfect!

329
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,180
My sword can even
cut through steel!

330
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,596
I hope you're kidding, pal.

331
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,600
If I break this arm again, there's
a girl who's gonna wring my neck!

332
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,120
That's Ed's.

333
00:21:33,444 --> 00:21:35,044
Whoppsie.

334
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:40,330
[Fighting Sounds]

335
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,780
Those reflexes.

336
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,350
Why, you!

337
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,810
Curious child?

338
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,060
An anchoring seal.

339
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,680
Bodiless armor.

340
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,700
He's just like Al.

341
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,880
Episode 20, Soul
of the Guardian.

342
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,600
We've cried some, laughed
a lot, even seen hell together.

343
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,140
How could all of my
memories be fake?
