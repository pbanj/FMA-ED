1
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:18,613
If he's really a prophet, who can make
miracles whenever he wants, then why is it

2
00:00:18,638 --> 00:00:19,677
turning out like this?

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:21,970
Please, cease fighting.

4
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,082
Surrender to the military, we will
not let you inside. Surrender,
This is your final warning!

5
00:00:43,653 --> 00:00:47,063
But Rose, isn't it bad
we're not fighting too?

6
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:50,076
What for?

7
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,250
Look at them all.

8
00:00:57,276 --> 00:00:59,396
Humans are foolish beyond salvation.

9
00:01:00,023 --> 00:01:01,785
Foolish, foolish.
HEHEHEHE

10
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,270
Don't be so hard on them.

11
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:06,310
After all our planning, I think this
mayhem feels nice.

12
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,076
Well, if it isn't our personal prophet.

13
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,282
Work well!

14
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,870
Please, I only mobilize the believers.

15
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:17,370
Before long, believers find differences
between each other and fight.

16
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,890
It's only better now, with the military
stepping into help.

17
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,210
No matter how many times they repeat the
lesson, they never learn.

18
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,730
Human beings are foolish, miserable
things, aren't they?

19
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,878
All this production.

20
00:01:30,903 --> 00:01:32,403
Just to make a philosopher's stone.

21
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,330
At least I can change now.

22
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,440
Back into this adorable form.

23
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,013
That one again?

24
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,080
You love making yourself look young.

25
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,600
What else can I do?

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,940
I've forgotten what I originally looked
like.

27
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,680
What are you doing here?

28
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,120
Where is Father Cornelo?

29
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,580
The real one?

30
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,900
What have you done with him?

31
00:02:00,146 --> 00:02:01,106
What should we say?

32
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,860
Why don't we tell him the truth,
lust?

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,560
Cornelo's been gone a rather long time.

34
00:02:04,561 --> 00:02:05,700
Can I eat him?

35
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:14,911
AAAHHHHHHHHH!

36
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:17,451
[Squelching noises]

37
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,491
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

38
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,160
To obtain something of equal value must be
lost.

39
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,653
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

40
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:37,162
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

41
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:12,517
Destruction's Right Hand.

42
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:18,785
Come to mention it, I did hear some juicy
information.

43
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,644
That curiosity of ours is left central,
heading eastward.

44
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:24,684
You mean the state alchemist killer?

45
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,210
The Flame Colonel's in the east now.

46
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,170
Who else?

47
00:04:28,171 --> 00:04:31,259
Well, you know the full metal pipsqueak is
there.

48
00:04:32,723 --> 00:04:33,243
Yes.

49
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:37,323
Right now, that boy is the closest one to
our goal.

50
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:41,722
We can't afford to have him moving around
acting on behalf of his own interests.

51
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,210
Not anymore.

52
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,110
I'm done, lust!

53
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,350
Now what have I told you?

54
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,670
Wipe your mouth, gluttony.

55
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:50,610
Sorry!

56
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,458
So, what of this killer?

57
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:56,449
We call him Scar.

58
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,350
That a code name?

59
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,530
I don't know, it's all that we've got.

60
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,930
Several eyewitnesses have described a man
with a large scar on his forehead fleeing

61
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:05,971
the scenes of the murders.

62
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:07,730
And you're sure he killed them all?

63
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,163
Five well-trained state alchemists all by
himself?

64
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:12,790
Nine, actually.

65
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:17,030
Five kills in central, four of them
alchemists.

66
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:21,051
Cops have turned up five more
state alchemists in various
other parts of the country.

67
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:25,496
If you throw in aides and guards who got
in the way, it's into the dozens.

68
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,130
We know it's him because the MO's
identical, and it's not the kind of thing

69
00:05:30,131 --> 00:05:31,010
you can copycat.

70
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,170
He explodes their brains, Roy,
and we don't know why he's doing it.

71
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,730
Everyone's panicked they'll be next.

72
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:41,390
So all of central command made the excuse
they were with the Fuhrer and came here

73
00:05:41,391 --> 00:05:44,950
en masse, thinking not even a killer would
come to this backwoods place.

74
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,490
You're here, after all.

75
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,330
Those up the chain that gave you this
demotion of a transfer three years ago,

76
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,230
they're aware of your abilities.

77
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,170
Your protection for them.

78
00:05:55,171 --> 00:05:57,790
Hell, Maes, now you're getting me shaken
up.

79
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:00,130
So that's the big question.

80
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,410
Who will be the next target?

81
00:06:01,977 --> 00:06:02,780
Pardon me.

82
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:03,990
Oh, thanks.

83
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:06,489
I'm very flattered, but I have
a three -year-old girl, see.

84
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,576
You have a call?

85
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,130
Oh, right.

86
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:09,550
Sorry.

87
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,270
Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, go ahead.

88
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:14,290
Understood.

89
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,150
I'll be right there.

90
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:19,210
Well, our question's been answered.

91
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:21,410
They found another soldier dead at his
guard station.

92
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,130
Skull blown up.

93
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,250
From the inside.

94
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:35,886
Dr. Marcoh?

95
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:37,659
You mean Master. Mauro?

96
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:38,519
No, Marcoh.

97
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,520
Sorry, this village only has one doctor,
and Master Mauro is his name.

98
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,120
As you can see, folks don't have much
money here.

99
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,200
Travel's hard.

100
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:52,360
I used to take a half-day trip to East
City to see a doctor before he came.

101
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,900
He's a nice man.

102
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,485
He'll take in any patient, even people
they said were incurable elsewhere.

103
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,086
When I got my leg caught under the tractor
and thought I was done, he fixed me like
you couldn’t even tell it had happened.

104
00:07:05,212 --> 00:07:09,659
He treated me when I was sick
too. There was a big flash of light.

105
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:13,881
Flash of light...

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,420
Yeah, it's got to be alchemy.

107
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,240
This is Dr. Marcoh.

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,660
But he's a fugitive.

109
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,040
Why would he become a miracle-performing
doctor?

110
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,479
He had to know what would draw attention.

111
00:07:25,299 --> 00:07:25,980
Down!

112
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,095
Why?

113
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,420
Al!

114
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,360
This is a bad idea.

115
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,796
I'm filling up with straw.

116
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:32,234
Shh!

117
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:36,830
Who's that?

118
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,650
A state alchemist.

119
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:39,930
I recognize him from HQ.

120
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,250
He's one of those guys who came in with
the Fuhrer.

121
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,010
But why is he here?

122
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,110
Did he follow us?

123
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,270
I don't know how else to explain it.

124
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,830
The colonel said he's never reported
Marcoh's whereabouts to Central Command.

125
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,000
Come on, Al.

126
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,280
We better go straight to Marcoh's from
here.

127
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,360
Ugh!

128
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,826
Ahhh!

129
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,340
Easy there, Doc.

130
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,560
We don't want any trouble.

131
00:08:11,612 --> 00:08:12,456
I know what you want.

132
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:13,856
You said you're a state alchemist.

133
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,664
You think you can take me back there?

134
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,100
Then you are Dr. Marcoh, The Crystal
Alchemist.

135
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,060
Is that really true?

136
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:19,960
No.

137
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,480
No more questions or orders.

138
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,680
I couldn't bear it going back to that
place.

139
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:24,480
That's not it.

140
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,120
Listen.

141
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,620
Put the gun down.

142
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,578
Please.

143
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,940
Or have you come to silence me?

144
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,180
Think you can kill me?

145
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,180
Well, I don't have to just let that
happen.

146
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:36,160
Al..

147
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,466
It's all okay.

148
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:41,820
Shoot if you want.

149
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
But I won't die.

150
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,700
You're the only one who might get hurt.

151
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,010
I see.

152
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:58,850
You're him.

153
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:01,210
You're the Full Metal Alchemist.

154
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,170
No, for the hundredth time!

155
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,930
That name belongs to me!

156
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,340
So I deserted the battlefield.

157
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:21,840
When I left, I stole all the research I'd
compiled at the time.

158
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,600
Their books.

159
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,500
My notes.

160
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,780
I have a hunch the military is
still looking for me so they
can see what I found out.

161
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,556
That's it.

162
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,280
Why, he sent us.

163
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,220
We're researching human transmutation.

164
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,160
Forget it.

165
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,180
I can't show you my work.

166
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,300
The orders from above notwithstanding.

167
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,700
I dirtied my hands with that research.

168
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,440
Then the military, they put it to use on
those people.

169
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,540
In that Eastern Rebellion massacre.

170
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,960
You mean the uprising in Ishbal?

171
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,729
That is what you're talking about.
Right?

172
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,540
Armageddon.

173
00:09:53,946 --> 00:09:56,446
That's the only word that fits that
battle.

174
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,420
Women.

175
00:09:57,673 --> 00:09:58,173
Children.

176
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,040
It didn't matter.

177
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,440
Everyone was killed.

178
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,940
And there wasn't any real reason.

179
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:06,220
All they said was the people of Ishbal
defied them.

180
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,140
Spoke out against the system.

181
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,200
What I was responsible for I could never
make up.

182
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,775
Even taking my life would be a token
gesture.

183
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,820
So I decided to vanish and become a
doctor.

184
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,660
Help people and slowly work off some
fraction of the debt.

185
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,760
Now get out.

186
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,960
I'm a ranking state alchemist.

187
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,167
I have a right to that research and
anything else you know.

188
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,300
You're way too small for these concerns.

189
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,920
I bet you were blinded by the abundant
privileges.

190
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,660
Access to research and prestige.

191
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,080
So you joined their ranks.

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,520
A foolish mistake.

193
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,080
If you'd been there during the rebellion
you'd feel the same way.

194
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,100
I know that.

195
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,620
I know what we're doing is stupid,
okay?

196
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,047
It's not your problem.

197
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:51,970
Dr. Marcoh.

198
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:55,690
About five years ago you
treated some babies in Xenotime.

199
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,930
I just want you to know they're fine now.

200
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,470
The red water's gone.

201
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,080
Brother, what are you doing?

202
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,653
Guesswork.

203
00:11:12,467 --> 00:11:13,960
Don't need circles.

204
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,220
Is this the red water from Xenotime?

205
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:19,393
No, it looks a lot clearer.

206
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,980
Stop!

207
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:21,500
Brother!

208
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,040
Get off of me!

209
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:24,601
This is wrong!

210
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
He's onto something!

211
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,540
Ed!

212
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,560
Let go!

213
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,540
It's not really liquid.

214
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,920
No, it's not.

215
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,600
It looks more like that ring the priest in
Lior had.

216
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,200
The Sage's Stone.

217
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,100
The Celestial Stone.

218
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,560
The Great Elixir.

219
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,895
The Red Teacher.

220
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,300
The Next Element.

221
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,220
Did you really think a substance of so
many names would be limited to just the

222
00:11:58,221 --> 00:11:59,686
form of a stone?

223
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,180
Brig...

224
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,500
Brigadier Grand.

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,140
Brigadier Basque?

226
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:06,040
Well, you've wormed your way up.

227
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,280
You're damn right, Crystal Alchemist.

228
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,160
And now you'll turn the Philosopher's
Stone and your research over to me.

229
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,980
The Philosopher's Stone?

230
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,881
That thing?

231
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,880
An experimental leap at best, roulette at
worst.

232
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,540
You never know when it will reach its
limit and backfire.

233
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,000
An unstable, destructive product,
different from the true stone.

234
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,000
But during the Rebellion, it
did augment our abilities and
make us tremendously powerful.

235
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:52,250
You're saying the military hasn't just
looked for the stone?

236
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,350
In the past, it's worked to develop it?

237
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:55,990
Never mind that it isn't perfect.

238
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,930
It was made by human hands and it worked!

239
00:12:57,931 --> 00:13:00,490
That proves the concept is possible.

240
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,110
The Philosopher's Stone's not a myth.

241
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,151
Where're the design specs.

242
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:07,630
And what do you mean to do with it when
you see it?

243
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,506
Increase your meddling, Fullmetal?

244
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:14,106
This research is top secret and falls
under my jurisdiction.

245
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,390
I can't permit you access to it.

246
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:17,930
Let's go.

247
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,490
No, let go of me!

248
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,390
Please!

249
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:22,810
I'm sorry I ran!

250
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:24,003
Have mercy!

251
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:26,630
You can't take me back.

252
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,650
I can't go back to that place.

253
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,650
It's too much.

254
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,870
I can't take it.

255
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:36,145
The testing, the experiments...
My hands are already stained!

256
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,810
Please!

257
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:40,630
This is just like before.

258
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:52,630
Brother!

259
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,250
Maybe I haven't grown an inch since then.

260
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:00,890
But I can't let my heart stay...

261
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,190
Stunted too!

262
00:14:21,926 --> 00:14:23,366
Who is that?

263
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,920
Finally, the Ironblood alchemist.

264
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,260
Basque Grand.

265
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,000
Your timing's too bad.

266
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,560
Just as I got my hands on this.

267
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,080
Get away!

268
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,140
That face...

269
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,724
That's the guy I saw in Central three
years ago.

270
00:14:58,038 --> 00:14:58,965
I'm sure of it.

271
00:14:59,512 --> 00:15:00,732
But never mind that.

272
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,300
This is messed up.

273
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,967
My mind's telling me to run.

274
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:06,080
But my legs are frozen stiff.

275
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,140
Crystal alchemist Dr. Marcoh.

276
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,584
I heard you were dead.

277
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,790
I'll have to take special care.

278
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,900
To wash you out of this world.

279
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,740
For your transgressions.

280
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:22,386
I see.

281
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:24,327
Yes, go ahead.

282
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,415
How can I protest?

283
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,399
In the name of the Great Almighty One.

284
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,080
Thou shalt perish.

285
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,440
It's okay.

286
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,460
Leave me behind.

287
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,900
You've really got to work on that
attitude.

288
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,020
Full metal alchemist Edward Elric.

289
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:43,057
You won't escape either.

290
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,740
He knows my name too?

291
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,300
What's going on here?

292
00:15:46,753 --> 00:15:48,473
What have I ever done to make enemies?

293
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,860
Okay, bad question.

294
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,700
But nothing bad enough to kill me over.

295
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,790
Brother, this way.

296
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:22,811
Come on!

297
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,350
Who in the hell are you?

298
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:39,437
What are you coming after us for?

299
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,910
If you're the creators of this society,
there must also be destroyers.

300
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,930
You can't understand.

301
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,089
Please, Ed, leave me and run.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,780
You have a kind look in your eyes.

303
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,340
My older brothers were exactly the same.

304
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:06,420
Eyes that were strong and peered into the
endless distance as if seeing something we

305
00:17:06,421 --> 00:17:06,822
could not.

306
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,380
It was three years ago, yes.

307
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,640
I was glad to hear you'd given up being a
state alchemist so I could take you off my

308
00:17:16,641 --> 00:17:17,000
list.

309
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,040
But now... Too bad, isn't it?

310
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,500
Too slow.

311
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:27,068
Brother!

312
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,420
Al!

313
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,060
Don't mistake your fortune.

314
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,280
That alchemy was designed for human flesh.

315
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,300
That's why you escaped with only a dent.

316
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,220
This time.

317
00:17:45,079 --> 00:17:45,939
Stay out of this.

318
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,380
My only enemies are state alchemists and
those who stand between.

319
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,633
But why?

320
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,540
Why are you after us?

321
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,080
Alchemists are those who take things away
from their natural form and convert them

322
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,620
into something grotesque.

323
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:04,933
In hubris, they profane God,
creator of all, claiming that
they have a better design.

324
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:11,102
I come as a right hand, an agent of God,
to carry out his judgments.

325
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm an alchemist too.

326
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,537
I may not have a state certification,
but... Why do you seek death?

327
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,120
I don't.

328
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:23,860
But you mentioned you had an older
brother, didn't you?

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,880
Then you should understand why I can't just
sit by and watch my brother get killed.

330
00:18:30,792 --> 00:18:32,521
Even you should... I do.

331
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,120
I understand exactly how it feels to watch
your brother murder before your eyes when

332
00:18:37,121 --> 00:18:38,160
you can't do a thing.

333
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,445
In fact, maybe.

334
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,540
I'll show Ed!

335
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,620
I told you you're too slow.

336
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,223
Auto-mail.

337
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:04,090
So your right arm begets nothing but
destruction also.

338
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,970
Don't you start with that.

339
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,430
We're nothing alike, pal.

340
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,710
That State alchemist?

341
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,839
What's he doing here?

342
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,030
You've come for Dr. Marcoh?

343
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm sorry I'm late.

344
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,640
The Lieutenant-Colonel ordered me to tail
you as protection.

345
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:41,580
What?

346
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,720
You mean Hughes did?

347
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,640
I heard you on my way in here.

348
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:48,500
You say you're an agent of God.

349
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:52,822
Well, then why don't you try passing
judgment on me?

350
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,340
That's Alex Louis Armstrong, the Strong
-Arm Alchemist!

351
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,480
What a righteous day this is turning into.

352
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,780
That you would come here and save me the
tribulations of finding you.

353
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,480
Blessed God, full of grace.

354
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,760
Don't pray just yet.

355
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,180
You're facing the technique that's been
passed down the Armstrong line for

356
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:12,661
generations.

357
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,302
That's hardly a blessing!

358
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,100
Next shot!

359
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,820
As you can see, it's only children here.

360
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,841
I doubt the gorillas you're looking for
are four feet tall.

361
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,760
Does this mean you've abandoned the so
-called teachings of your little priest?

362
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,100
All right, then.

363
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:44,040
Tell us where the rebel faction is that's
resisting the military governance.

364
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,240
Why should I?

365
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,580
We came to liberate this town from that
tyrant, Cornelo.

366
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,640
We're trying to help you.

367
00:20:51,947 --> 00:20:53,116
What are you, blind?

368
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,260
You're not interested in helping.

369
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,600
You're here for control.

370
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,040
This is our village, not yours.

371
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,580
We're the only ones who can make it
better.

372
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,680
We'll fix it ourselves.

373
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:04,760
We've got legs.

374
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,180
We'll get up and use them!

375
00:21:21,897 --> 00:21:23,097
You dropped this.

376
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,980
But isn't this what you're after?

377
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:31,000
Didn't you think about taking it yourself
and leaving?

378
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:31,600
Of course.

379
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,620
And a younger me would have walked away
with it without a second thought.

380
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,980
But I can't forget the faces of all those
people we saw today.

381
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,920
And you used that in their treatments,
right?

382
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,180
That stone belongs to them.

383
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,600
And so do you.

384
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,280
You ready?

385
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,800
Then let's head out.

386
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:59,440
We've got to find someplace where the
military and that killer won't find us.

387
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,040
You think we could escape?

388
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,560
You've got legs, don't you?

389
00:22:04,561 --> 00:22:05,721
Yeah, let's put them to work.

390
00:23:38,573 --> 00:23:42,800
Fullmetal Alchemist,
Episode 15 The Ishbal  Massacre.

391
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,760
We didn't know anything about the
bloodshed, but you can't use ignorance to

392
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:48,889
escape responsibility.

393
00:23:49,653 --> 00:23:50,973
Not with him.
