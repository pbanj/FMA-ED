1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:11,500
Mr. Hughes?

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:13,360
Hey, it's me again.

3
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,750
That damn Winry!

4
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:36,856
She needs to be a little more
careful when she does a tune-up.

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:37,550
Peace of...

6
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:46,470
Now what are we gonna do?

7
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:48,530
It's still a long way to Ishbal.

8
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,970
We're walking, Al.

9
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,830
It's the only thing we can do.

10
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:52,350
What?

11
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:53,610
That's impossible!

12
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,090
I mean, I could do it, but
there's no way you can!

13
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,370
You got a better idea?

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:02,430
There's not a train that goes anywhere near
Ishbal, and the roads have all been shut down.

15
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,550
And it's not like we can
ask the military for anything.

16
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:08,730
That's true, but there's...
Stop whining and start walking.

17
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:12,470
We're not getting any closer to Ishbal
standing around in the desert like this.

18
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:13,110
Let's go.

19
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:14,710
Brother!

20
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:18,310
He should really learn
to plan things better.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,414
Humankind can not gain anything,
without first giving something in return.

22
00:01:24,538 --> 00:01:27,330
to obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

23
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,270
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:37,090
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

25
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:24,520
See, Al?

26
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,680
Everything turned out fine.

27
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,440
No problem.

28
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,500
What do you mean?

29
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:30,140
We made it to some
random town, that's all.

30
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,900
Since when did you
become such a pessimist?

31
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,940
We can probably find a
car in this town or something.

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,380
And what would we
do if we did find one?

33
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,900
No one would ever sell
a car to a couple of kids.

34
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,080
Well, guess we'll
just have to find out.

35
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,400
Brother, you shouldn't
be so impulsive.

36
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,500
You gotta learn
to plan things out.

37
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,600
Think ahead a little bit.

38
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,120
I am planning things out.

39
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:50,920
No, you're not!

40
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,660
You're... what you're about
to do is just... it's... What?

41
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,200
It's just what?

42
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,940
Are you sure we're
doing the right thing?

43
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,600
I mean, of course
we have to stop Scar.

44
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,780
I understand that.

45
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,160
And the whole point of all this is to
get our bodies back the way they were.

46
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,780
But what happens after that?

47
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,540
Beats me, Al.

48
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,480
Why don't you tell me?

49
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,260
I don't know.

50
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,440
It's just...

51
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,520
Maybe we should concentrate on
the Homunculi before we go after Scar.

52
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,080
What are you talking about, Al?

53
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,880
If you're worried
about something, say it.

54
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,480
All I mean is, there
might be a better option.

55
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,980
We just need to think it over.

56
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,380
You're not making any sense.

57
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,680
Listen to me!

58
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,120
We need to stop and think
about what we're doing!

59
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:36,880
Shut up!

60
00:04:37,345 --> 00:04:38,240
You think it over, Al!

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,240
What?

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,400
What are you doing?

63
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,040
There!

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,040
Tell me if you get
any good ideas.

65
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,300
Very funny!

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,800
Now you're gonna get it!

67
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,800
That should cool off
that head of yours.

68
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,140
Thanks!

69
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,440
I'm thinking much clearer now!

70
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,140
And I see you
dug yourself a hole.

71
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
Brother, stop it!

72
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,580
Take this!

73
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Take that!

74
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:11,860
Dammit!

75
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,400
Brother, stop it!

76
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,560
Please!

77
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,460
Wait until I get my
real hands on you?

78
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:27,550
What's wrong with you?

79
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,710
Why do you always
have to be so stubborn?

80
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,390
I am not being stubborn, Al!

81
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:32,330
Yes, you are!

82
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,070
If you weren't so stubborn,
we wouldn't even be here!

83
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,419
We could have
asked Dad for help!

84
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:37,085
Are you kidding?

85
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,110
I'll never ask that
bastard for anything!

86
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,870
And that's exactly what
makes you stubborn!

87
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:42,630
Shut up!

88
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,090
Do whatever you want.

89
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:48,010
Brother!

90
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:49,790
Brother!

91
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:50,630
Come back!

92
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,190
Nice to see you again.

93
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,490
Miss, uh...

94
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,630
Miss Bookworm.

95
00:05:58,005 --> 00:05:59,650
I'm sorry, I can't
remember your name.

96
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:00,630
Hey, Sheska.

97
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:02,590
Yeah, right.

98
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,530
And your name
is Windy, isn't it?

99
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,530
It's Winry.

100
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:06,750
Right!

101
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:07,550
Sorry.

102
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,230
I'm sorry, what were
you going to say?

103
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,890
No, please, after you.

104
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,230
Uh, well, um...

105
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,130
There's something important
that I wanted to discuss with you.

106
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,270
What is it?

107
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:23,830
Hmm...

108
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,850
I've been investigating the
death of Lieutenant Colonel...

109
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:33,230
I mean, the death of Brigadier General Hughes on
my own, secretly, for a pretty long time now, actually.

110
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:37,230
The Lieutenant Colonel... I
mean, Brigadier General Hugh...

111
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,030
How about Mr. Hughes?

112
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,590
All right, I guess I
can call him that.

113
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,070
Go on.

114
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,390
It's kind of strange.

115
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:47,870
Strange?

116
00:06:49,530 --> 00:06:52,590
The deeper I investigate, the
more peculiar things become.

117
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,530
I'm scared.

118
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,290
I don't know what to do.

119
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,750
But why are you
telling me all of this?

120
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:01,510
Because I can't trust
anybody in the military.

121
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:04,030
Not even Colonel Mustang, now.

122
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:05,910
Please!

123
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,570
I can't take it anymore!

124
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,290
If someone doesn't
listen to me, I'll... I'll...

125
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,610
Hey, calm down!

126
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:13,150
I understand.

127
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,750
It'll be all right.

128
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:15,830
Thanks.

129
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,290
I knew I could count on you.

130
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:22,370
What's his problem, anyway?

131
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,210
He complains about everything.

132
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:26,410
Hey, Al.

133
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,450
Pass the salt.

134
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:45,550
These are all of the documents that I
arranged and then copied for Mr. Hughes.

135
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:50,969
And... and this is all of the material that I've gathered
on my own based on what I found in those documents.

136
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,910
Sheska, listen, you don't expect
me to read all of this now, do you?

137
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,090
Yeah, why not?

138
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,090
That's impossible!

139
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,277
Reading all of that
would take me months!

140
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,388
Yeah, I guess you're right.

141
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,170
I'll just summarize it for you.

142
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,310
It all started with the
collapse of Lab Five.

143
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:12,470
There's no way I can find out what happened
there, because there aren't any records for that facility.

144
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,330
But that lab's definitely where
Mr. Hughes began his investigation.

145
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,030
And then...

146
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,350
And then what did you find out?

147
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,350
What happened after that?

148
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:23,310
Oh, right.

149
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:28,310
Mr. Hughes was investigating Lab Five, and
he was researching the Civil War in Ishbal, too.

150
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:29,210
Ishbal?

151
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,090
Now, it's only speculation,
of course, but I think...

152
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:36,890
I think that during his investigation, he must have
found out about something that he really shouldn't have.

153
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,990
And he was killed.

154
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,630
Wait!

155
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:42,170
Okay!

156
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:42,930
I understand!

157
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,030
Please, don't cry!

158
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,550
Brother, you numbskull.

159
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,510
Hey!

160
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:53,670
Come on, Al!

161
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:55,330
If you're worried
about something, say it!

162
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,550
I did!

163
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,490
I was trying to tell you that in
the end, we'll have to face her.

164
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,200
Brother, where did you go?

165
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:10,700
I've...

166
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,300
Marta!

167
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:14,880
Long time no see.

168
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,580
After examining these documents, I
noticed that one name kept popping up.

169
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,120
What name?

170
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:21,640
Who?

171
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,120
Colonel Juliet Douglas.

172
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,120
They say she sparked the uprising in
Ishbal by accidentally shooting a child.

173
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,860
But there's a small problem.

174
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,900
According to buried records, she died in an
accident two years before the war even began.

175
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:34,295
Oh.

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,320
Here.

177
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,780
Take a look at this picture.

178
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,640
What?

179
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,780
What's going on here?

180
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,020
I found all of this in
Mr. Hughes' investigation files.

181
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,840
He got this story from a
newspaper in her hometown.

182
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,160
Okay.

183
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:52,420
So a woman named Juliet
Douglas died two years before.

184
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,980
But do you think it's a mistake?

185
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,180
Like in the records?

186
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,745
Or maybe someone
with the same name?

187
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,800
The government and the
military records match up.

188
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,480
It's no mistake.

189
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:02,600
But that's not
the strangest part.

190
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,140
What is?

191
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,000
She's still on active
duty in the military.

192
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,320
Look.

193
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,740
Here.

194
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,300
What is going on?

195
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:14,920
Just what I've said.

196
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:19,700
The woman dies two years before the
war, yet the military says she participated in it.

197
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,740
Not only that, they
basically say she caused it.

198
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:27,980
And yet afterwards she inexplicably landed a huge
promotion as the Führer's secretary where she is today.

199
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,540
That's so weird.

200
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,260
Someone who should be
dead is the Führer's secretary?

201
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,040
But that's not the end of it.

202
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,760
What?

203
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,480
There's more?

204
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:41,220
If this same woman was alive, she
would at least be in her fifties by now.

205
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:48,060
But the Juliet Douglas I saw working as the Führer's
secretary is in her thirties no matter how you look at her!

206
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,840
She doesn't die and
she doesn't get any older.

207
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,860
What the hell is she?

208
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,320
None of this information
makes any sense.

209
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,380
But after a lot of thought and
deliberation, I've come up with a hypothesis.

210
00:11:04,289 --> 00:11:05,189
hypothesis?

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,980
And when you look at it this way, all of
the discrepancies begin to make sense.

212
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,320
Miss Douglas is actually...

213
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,220
...an alien.

214
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,860
I think that hypothesis
needs some work.

215
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,294
Huh?

216
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,140
What else could she possibly be?

217
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,560
I'm sorry, I really don't know.

218
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,660
But I think if we can keep digging, then we
can find out exactly who murdered Mr. Hughes.

219
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,880
But what can we do?

220
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,420
I work for the military, but all I
really do is take care of records.

221
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:51,680
And Juliet Douglas is with the Führer, so there's no
way that I can get close enough to her to investigate.

222
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,760
I can't even find
out what she's doing.

223
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:59,300
If we eavesdropped on her conversations,
I think we could get some more information.

224
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,360
Eavesdropping?

225
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:04,740
That's the kind of thing that husbands do to their
wives when they want proof for divorce hearings, right?

226
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,300
I couldn't possibly do that.

227
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,000
Oh, yes you can.

228
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,480
I'll help you.

229
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,230
Marta, what are you doing here?

230
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,690
Following you.

231
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,970
I want you to tell me
about your enemy, Al.

232
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:23,010
Enemy?

233
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,870
You know, the ones
dressed in black clothes.

234
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,250
Why do you want
to know about them?

235
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:30,650
Why else?

236
00:12:30,651 --> 00:12:31,970
For revenge.

237
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,770
Sorry about my
uniform being too small.

238
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:45,270
Well, when you're doing a lot of manual
labor, your arms get big, you know?

239
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,650
I never really noticed before.

240
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:52,750
Anyway, about the case, I really think
that, uh, that's what I should be the one to do.

241
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:05,700
Hey, what is it?

242
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:07,780
Nothing.

243
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,010
Did you know those two
officers in the hallway?

244
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,710
Yeah, we've met before.

245
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,490
This is it.

246
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,750
All of the phone lines are
connected and routed in this facility.

247
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:21,550
Hmm.

248
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:25,210
As you can see, they've put
quite a few locks on the door.

249
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,070
And the alarm system is
probably connected here as well.

250
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:30,450
We're going to have
a hard time getting in.

251
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,710
It's open.

252
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,064
Huh?

253
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,190
What?

254
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,350
This is all baby stuff, really.

255
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,850
Oh, okay.

256
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,010
Come on, let's go.

257
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:45,270
All right, what's the
Führer's room number?

258
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,970
Room 103 in Central Hall.

259
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,610
Room 103, okay.

260
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,110
Here we go.

261
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:52,750
Right.

262
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,670
And we're hooked in.

263
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,930
Now all we have to do is wait.

264
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,580
That's wrong.

265
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,520
That means that Law and Greed's
efforts to protect you were for nothing.

266
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,080
It doesn't make any sense.

267
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,720
You know what I am, don't you?

268
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,580
I'm a Chimera, and I've gone through
too much to live a normal life now.

269
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,640
Greed and my fellow comrades, they
were the only semblance of a family I had left.

270
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,340
But revenge?

271
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,280
That's no way to... There's
no point in trying to stop me.

272
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,460
I'm half snake.

273
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,360
Vengeance is in my blood.

274
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,700
But... but you
can't... you just...

275
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,540
She's just like Scar.

276
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,820
There's no other reason for
me to live anymore but revenge.

277
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:42,296
And besides, Al, they're
your enemies too, aren't they?

278
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,640
We'll be helping each other out.

279
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:49,267
I don't plan to help you with your
revenge, so I'm not going to tell you anything.

280
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,840
I can't.

281
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,020
But why not?

282
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,996
Because I'm sure that Law and your
other comrades would say the same thing.

283
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,740
So...

284
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:58,780
Goodbye.

285
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,900
Vengeance is raw.

286
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,340
I do have to stop them.

287
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,640
Both Marta and Scar.

288
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,040
Al?

289
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:12,980
Al!

290
00:15:16,615 --> 00:15:18,500
Looking for him always
gives me a headache.

291
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:31,480
Edward?

292
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,160
Edward?

293
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,740
I can't find Alphonse anywhere.

294
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Have you seen him?

295
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,460
Did something happen?

296
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,080
Who cares where he is?

297
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,680
I don't.

298
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,980
You boys fighting?

299
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,700
It's all because of him.

300
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,940
Al keeps nagging me wanting to know
when Dad's coming back like I know.

301
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,440
That can be rough.

302
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:56,440
Well, I hope nothing happens
to your brother while he's alone.

303
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,720
If only I knew
where to find him.

304
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,560
Why am I always the
one who has to do this?

305
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,740
Come on.

306
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,400
Let's go.

307
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,060
Kay!

308
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,160
Führer's office.

309
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,060
May I help you?

310
00:16:48,265 --> 00:16:50,140
There's a call coming
in from a public line.

311
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,560
The code is... 08.

312
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,340
Put it through.

313
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,500
Showtime!

314
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:00,800
Hey, guess who?

315
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,640
Envy.

316
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:05,580
You know the use of insecure lines
is forbidden unless it's an emergency.

317
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,420
Don't be so uptight.

318
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:09,880
You're the one who
told me to report in.

319
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,040
I'm almost there.

320
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,920
It's too quiet here.

321
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:18,040
I think if they don't make a move soon,
I'll... You'll complete your mission loyally.

322
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,660
Understood?

323
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,320
What?

324
00:17:21,321 --> 00:17:21,880
Envy?

325
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,660
That's the Homunculus
Ed was talking about.

326
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,180
I've gotta go.

327
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,800
It looks like I have
another job to do here.

328
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,400
Maybe we should
disconnect it now.

329
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,480
Right.

330
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,160
Good idea.

331
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:46,980
Hmm.

332
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,640
What a weird conversation.

333
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,100
I wonder what it
could have been about.

334
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,220
Who knows?

335
00:17:52,221 --> 00:17:55,500
But it did sound like they were talking
about something big and dangerous.

336
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,452
What do you think?

337
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,578
I think we'll still have to
gather some more evidence.

338
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,200
That was strange,
but not incriminating.

339
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,240
Even if we eavesdrop, this
still isn't going to be easy.

340
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,520
We'll have to check in
at different times, so we...

341
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,280
What's wrong?

342
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,250
We gotta run!

343
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,670
Come on, hurry!

344
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:30,436
What is that thing?

345
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,536
How should i know?

346
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,320
just keep moving!

347
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,710
Slow down!

348
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:38,630
What is it?

349
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:39,270
What's going on?

350
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:39,713
It was her!

351
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,850
It was that girl!

352
00:18:48,611 --> 00:18:49,091
There.

353
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,559
The door!

354
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:57,720
Winry!

355
00:19:14,271 --> 00:19:15,531
it's their mom...

356
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:18,750
Ed and Al's mom.

357
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,170
It's her.

358
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:24,726
Winry!

359
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:29,820
I had a feeling that
was you in the hallway.

360
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,100
What are you doing here?

361
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,120
What's going on?

362
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,220
Saved.

363
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:39,500
I knew it! I knew it!

364
00:19:39,501 --> 00:19:40,420
She is an alien!

365
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:41,760
Alien?

366
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,020
Come on.

367
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:03,760
Let's go.

368
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:04,780
Huh?

369
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:08,540
Brother?

370
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,380
We're going to Ishbal.

371
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,300
You're right.

372
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,220
We've got to stop Scar.

373
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,420
How did you know
where to find me?

374
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,460
You haven't changed at all.

375
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:31,220
Huh?

376
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,520
When you were little and we had a
fight, I'd always find you sitting by the river.

377
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,020
Hmm.

378
00:20:37,955 --> 00:20:39,000
Yeah, you're right.

379
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,400
What are we gonna do now?

380
00:20:44,401 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess we'll have to walk.

381
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,622
We don't really
have a lot of options.

382
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,260
Huh?

383
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,220
Hey!

384
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,000
Wanna lift?

385
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,460
Marta!

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,460
Who's that?

387
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,600
You know her, Al?

388
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,440
Uh, well, yeah.

389
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,320
Sort of.

390
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,640
All right, then.

391
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,640
What are we waiting for?

392
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:02,080
Let's go!

393
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,760
No, brother!

394
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,420
Wait!

395
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,660
It's no big deal.

396
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,881
I'm just trying to help
out someone in a bind.

397
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,710
Don't think this
changes anything.

398
00:21:17,785 --> 00:21:19,550
I won't let you do it.

399
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,950
Everybody ready?

400
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:24,850
Yeah!

401
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,410
Let's go!

402
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,140
What's wrong?

403
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,320
Oh, nothing.

404
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,820
I was just thinking.

405
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,700
Of what?

406
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,900
Remember the first time
we actually got in a fistfight?

407
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:43,680
Oh, yeah.

408
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:45,857
You curled your little hand
and punched me in the face.

409
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,780
That was the first time
I went to sit by the river.

410
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:49,760
Is that so?

411
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:50,980
Yep.

412
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,680
You always went missing out.

413
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:53,556
Even after we had a fight.

414
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,118
Even when we were
studying with Teacher.

415
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,580
I had to do the work
for both of us back then.

416
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,340
We fought about who was
gonna marry Winry, too.

417
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,740
We did?

418
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:02,420
Really?

419
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,080
Yeah.

420
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,920
That's when we
fought the hardest.

421
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,720
Fullmetal Alchemist

422
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,540
Episode 39,
Secret of Ishbal.

423
00:23:43,605 --> 00:23:47,040
The battleground that Scar has
chosen is a place we'll never forget.

424
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,880
It's a town called... LIOR.
