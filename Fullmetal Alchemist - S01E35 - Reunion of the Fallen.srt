1
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,306
Funny, I hear greed
finally bit the big one.

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,375
Indeed.

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,915
And in a sense, his death
suited him in the most perfect way.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,935
Violence so intense, it
bordered on the beautiful.

5
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:26,486
Ed can murder us all he wants.

6
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,295
You know who
will just replace us.

7
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:32,230
Speaking of, Sloth is taking
care of the new wrath as we speak.

8
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,015
Just think of the
possibilities it'll present.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,115
Is something wrong?

10
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,106
Don't let this get to you.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,606
Greed was weak, so he died.

12
00:00:41,630 --> 00:00:42,315
End of story.

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,655
It's not that.

14
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:47,475
Have you ever wondered
where we come from?

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,616
Or where we go after we're dead?

16
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:53,335
You're a mess.

17
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:57,570
Sorry, folks, but if you don't mind,
I'm just about to close up shop here.

18
00:00:57,571 --> 00:00:59,475
Do what you will,
but we're not leaving.

19
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:00,686
Oh, you're not, huh?

20
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:02,566
We've grown to
like it here at Tubbs.

21
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:03,737
I think we'll be staying.

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:05,906
Now you listen to me!

23
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:06,653
Hey, stranger!

24
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,155
Lousy service.

25
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,006
Can I eat him?

26
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,306
Can I eat him?

27
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,455
We did skip dessert.

28
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,115
See you outside.

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,285
The thought keeps rising like
a bubble to the top of my mind.

30
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,025
Where did I come from?

31
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,245
Where will I go?

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,096
Oh no!

33
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,176
Jimmy, talk to me!

34
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,305
Say something!

35
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,825
Excuse me!

36
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,705
Make way!

37
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,796
May I see him?

38
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,928
I might be able to help.

39
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,976
There you go.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,785
Good as new.

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,745
I can't thank you enough!

42
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,615
Is that you?

43
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,335
Lujon...

44
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,235
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

45
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:41,895
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

46
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:45,355
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

47
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:51,815
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,125
Are you sure we're
on the right road?

49
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,145
All I know is we're heading south, and we're
bound to run into the Ishbal camp sooner or later.

50
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,345
Sooner than later, I hope.

51
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:52,096
But what makes you believe the Ishbalan refugees will
tell you anything about the Philosopher's Stone anyway, Ed?

52
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,665
Because it's the only lead we've got, and we have to
take every chance that we have to get closer to the stone.

53
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,665
What is it?

54
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,325
I thought... I thought I heard a
woman scream just now, but I'm...

55
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,185
No, get away!

56
00:05:25,172 --> 00:05:26,437
Who the hell are you?

57
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:27,885
Come on, guys.

58
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,696
A band of thugs in the forest?

59
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,876
That's so cliché.

60
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,345
What was that, shortstop?

61
00:05:42,217 --> 00:05:42,962
Ed.....

62
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,455
It's been two years.

63
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,246
I never thought I'd see you again,
and I've got so much to tell you.

64
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:54,215
But before I go into that, there's
something I need to ask you.

65
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,895
It's just... I've never been
able to come to terms with it.

66
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,606
The reason you left,
Lust, can you tell me that?

67
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,675
You just disappeared.

68
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,852
You didn't even say goodbye.

69
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:06,066
That was a long time ago.

70
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,915
You can't expect me to recall.

71
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,335
I sure as hell do!

72
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,175
Everything I know that's
meaningful, I learned from you!

73
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:13,355
Alchemy!

74
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,015
And more delicate things.

75
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,315
About life.

76
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,175
Why have you come here?

77
00:06:18,285 --> 00:06:19,662
You've never left your village.

78
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,455
Are you looking for something?

79
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,615
Well, yes.

80
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,395
I'm in search of a new stone.

81
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,935
You recall that, right?

82
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,435
Thanks to the Philosopher's Stone you gave me, I
saved my whole village from that horrible disease.

83
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,735
But now, somehow, that
damn sickness has returned.

84
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:36,155
And the power of
the stone has faded.

85
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,015
Please.

86
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,386
Will you lend me
your strength again?

87
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,830
Help me save them
like you did before

88
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:42,516
Lust?

89
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,815
I need you.

90
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,635
It must have been a landslide.

91
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:53,915
Just look at all those bodies.

92
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,226
Can I eat them?

93
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,735
Can I eat them, please?

94
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,366
No, leave them be.

95
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,615
I've been meaning
to put you on a diet.

96
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,665
We have a survivor.

97
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,245
Take these.

98
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:10,965
Please.

99
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,140
Take these herbs
back to my village.

100
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,845
They need them desperately.

101
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,105
Over there!

102
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,976
I see them!

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,905
If anyone can hear me, answer!

104
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,005
Lydia.

105
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,005
Lydia!

106
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,076
Come on, Lydia.

107
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,745
Hold on.

108
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,205
I'm so sorry, Lujon.

109
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,985
Here, take them.

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,156
I told you not to go.

111
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,425
It was too dangerous.

112
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,545
These herbs won't
do us any good.

113
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,216
What are you two doing here?

114
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,365
I saw you earlier back
in the carriage, right?

115
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,745
You should leave.

116
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:45,836
Or it's too late.

117
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,507
There's an outbreak
of fossil disease.

118
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:50,727
And no one who's contracted
it has survived for very long.

119
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,145
That's why we've come.

120
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,445
I'll cure it.

121
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,805
I'll wipe that disease
off the face of the planet.

122
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,905
You'll see.

123
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:59,645
I'll do it with alchemy.

124
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,845
So you're traveling by
yourself to find this Lujon guy?

125
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:10,945
Yes.

126
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,045
You shouldn't have come alone.

127
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,940
It can be pretty
dangerous out here.

128
00:08:14,941 --> 00:08:17,376
Even if you do have
someone along to help you out.

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,305
I know.

130
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,666
But I had a feeling if I didn't come,
I'd never get to see Lujon again.

131
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,456
And I don't know if I
could deal with that.

132
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,325
So, why is it that this Lujon guy
left your village in the first place?

133
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,536
For good reason.

134
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,605
To search for another
Philosopher's Stone.

135
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,725
That's nice.

136
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,045
The stone?!

137
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,575
Yes.

138
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:46,995
In order to cure a horrible epidemic in my village,
we need the power of the Philosopher's Stone.

139
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:51,926
So Lujon set
out in search of it.

140
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:58,135
Because only the stone has the power to combat
the terrible disease that no medicine can cure.

141
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:00,926
Okay, Lydia.

142
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,655
Drink this.

143
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,355
It should make you feel better.

144
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,595
Thanks, Lujon.

145
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,975
Looks like you came out
pretty unscathed, considering.

146
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:10,535
Lydia!

147
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,730
What is it?

148
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:12,206
What's wrong?

149
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:12,915
Are you hurt?

150
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,766
No, it's nothing.

151
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,795
The saucer just
slipped out of my hand.

152
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:17,806
Lujon!

153
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,675
Are you here?

154
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,535
It's my son.

155
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,815
He needs help.

156
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:29,735
The body becomes like stone.

157
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,495
Soon it'll be solid.

158
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,835
Motionless.

159
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,475
He'll die.

160
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,395
Frozen in agony.

161
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,015
All things evil and unclean
must leave this child at once.

162
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:48,110
Almighty, hear the cries of
pain and anguish and give aid.

163
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:53,855
Answer the prayers of the stricken child and
drive from his body the evil that dwells within him.

164
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,546
The enemy will fall
in cower and shame.

165
00:09:56,570 --> 00:10:00,135
Victory will belong to the light,
which conquers the curse of darkness.

166
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,585
I'm sorry.

167
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,825
Vanjie, no!

168
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,076
He can't!

169
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,116
He can't!

170
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,905
He was my only son!

171
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,061
How could this happen?

172
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,565
All of my efforts
haven't done anything!

173
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,885
What's the point
in even trying now?

174
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,685
Please, hear your loyal servant.

175
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,765
Just send us aid.

176
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,496
Please help us.

177
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,085
Please help me.

178
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,445
Help me save her, Ishbala.

179
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,605
I love her so much.

180
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,865
God of Ishbal, please
don't take her from me.

181
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,425
Spare their lives.

182
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,745
I beg you.

183
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,385
Breaking down the body's dead
parts, those already lost to the disease,

184
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:15,485
and rebuilding them to their original state seems to be your
only recourse now that conventional medicine has failed.

185
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,745
You are too inexperienced
with alchemy to do that.

186
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,345
But I will teach you.

187
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,365
You'll learn the
power of true Alchemy.

188
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,496
I'm so glad you're coming
back to the village with me.

189
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,685
I can't say that enough.

190
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:48,276
I told everyone back home I was
leaving to look for the Philosopher's Stone,

191
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,385
and that was the truth.

192
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,605
But really, I was hoping I
would find you most of all.

193
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,845
I wanted to see you as well.

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,771
I've had this strong
feeling since I left.

195
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:02,625
Like a door left unclosed.

196
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,385
It's really no problem.

197
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,540
We're headed that
way ourselves, actually.

198
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,125
Glad to hear it.

199
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:14,845
But I still feel bad for going
back home without finding Lujon.

200
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,305
Well, what did you expect?

201
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,785
If you don't have any good
leads, how can you find him?

202
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:20,545
It's certainly not your fault.

203
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,105
I don't mean to pry, but is
this Lujon guy your boyfriend?

204
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,916
I know it's none of my business.

205
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,385
Not quite.

206
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,085
He left me.

207
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:32,862
To be honest, I've loved him
as long as I can remember.

208
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,585
But there's another woman
he loves far more than me.

209
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,685
So this is where you
practice the great art.

210
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,265
It's quite a library.

211
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,085
Hey, what are you doing?

212
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,765
They're mostly junk.

213
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,165
The first step is finding
which ones are true.

214
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,765
I want you to read
these all in exact order.

215
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,465
And memorize every word.

216
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,280
I can't!

217
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,076
I just can't get
my head around it!

218
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,185
I don't understand!

219
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,336
It's okay, you will in due time.

220
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:22,485
You have talent,
so be confident.

221
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,565
It does wonders for a man.

222
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:42,535
These memories... why
does he make me have them?

223
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,715
And who is that man?

224
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,080
Good.

225
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:16,965
That's right.

226
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,765
What's this?

227
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,445
It's my gift to you.

228
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:25,825
This Philosopher's Stone will magnify your
Alchemic power and help you get the things you desire.

229
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:33,076
Man must crawl before he
walks and walk before he flies.

230
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:37,025
See if you can return this bird to the air
and then maybe you're ready to move on.

231
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:43,736
May the great creator save this creature
and watch over him so he does not stray.

232
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,456
Let it be so through day and
night under sun and moon.

233
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,805
No evil shall harm him.

234
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:51,925
As I, a humble servant, employ the knowledge
that God gave us to bring him back to life.

235
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,785
I actually did it!

236
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,176
Well, what did I
tell you, Lujon?

237
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,985
I knew you had talent
buried somewhere.

238
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,665
It's all because of you.

239
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,045
Thank you.

240
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,625
I have to ask again.

241
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:24,756
Why did you have to abandon
me the way you did, Lust?

242
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,680
Why did you run away?

243
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,785
You must have known how I felt.

244
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,745
Or did you even care at all?

245
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:43,505
You shouldn't seek all
the answers, believe me.

246
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,945
You might not
like what you find.

247
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,905
I don't understand.

248
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,745
What are you trying to say?

249
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,925
I'm not too proud.

250
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:54,156
I'll beg you, please
don't take him from me.

251
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,085
Did he tell you that we're
engaged, Lujon and I?

252
00:15:57,340 --> 00:16:00,665
We're going to be married
just as soon as I get better.

253
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,985
My, how sweet.

254
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,796
You'll have to invite
me to the wedding.

255
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,565
I'll be sure to
catch the bouquet.

256
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,616
Stop treating me like a child!

257
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,116
I mean it!

258
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:10,905
Leave us alone!

259
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:27,415
Lydia, with this power
I will make you well.

260
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:32,275
Let the disease which wrecks
her body in pain be forced out.

261
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,995
Let the pure body
reject the evil presence.

262
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,635
Watch over her, God.

263
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:41,630
So that through all hours of the day and
night, under sun and moon, she might be

264
00:16:41,631 --> 00:16:44,595
cleansed of this plague
and protected from harm.

265
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:54,415
That's amazing.

266
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,226
Lujon, save my son!

267
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,175
Help me!

268
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,565
How have the lessons been going?

269
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,145
There's nothing to worry about.

270
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,645
Everything's going
exactly as planned.

271
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,296
I'm counting on you.

272
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,176
Why do you think I spread
this epidemic in the first place?

273
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,485
It wasn't just for laughs.

274
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,876
Lujon's managed to cure the disease
with a fake Philosopher's Stone.

275
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,965
They're so happy.

276
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,216
But that won't last for long as the power of the stone I
gave him becomes unstable and gradually fades away.

277
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,165
And then the ball
will start rolling.

278
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,260
And the man in the pit of despair with
the taste of forbidden fruit on his tongue

279
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,105
will search for the real
Philosopher's Stone.

280
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,285
And do our work for us.

281
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,025
We've done it time
and time again.

282
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,125
Deja vu or something.

283
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,505
And all for a little stone.

284
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,885
Excuse me.

285
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,625
Oh, Lydia.

286
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,085
You're as beautiful as ever.

287
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,176
Thank you.

288
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,745
Have you seen Lujon yet?

289
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,765
Isn't it about time for
the ceremony to start?

290
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,665
I don't know.

291
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,525
Probably.

292
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,025
Listen, I don't know
how to say this.

293
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:10,045
You've taught me
more than just alchemy.

294
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,441
Things I don't
want to just forget.

295
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,313
What are you talking about?

296
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,931
I want you by my side.

297
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,205
Forever.

298
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,025
Forever.

299
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:27,985
Who are you?

300
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,425
Why do you haunt me?

301
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,586
I want you to go to her, Lujon.

302
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:41,515
I can't.

303
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,095
You heard me.

304
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,415
Lust, please.

305
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:45,595
Right now.

306
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:48,235
Lydia!

307
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:54,426
Lust, you sure it's
okay we leave now?

308
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,335
Envy scary.

309
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,675
We're approaching the village.

310
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,075
Hold on, guys.

311
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,275
I've come back to help.

312
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,196
Catch me!

313
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,085
You're too fast!

314
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,605
You've saved me
and this village.

315
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,225
Just like you
did the first time.

316
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,285
Do you remember it now?

317
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:48,365
That day, I held you and
you were happy, I know.

318
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,805
But this time it's
gonna be different.

319
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,685
This time, I won't let go.

320
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:57,945
Don't go!

321
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:58,845
Please!

322
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,325
You don't have to
hide from how you feel.

323
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:01,845
No!

324
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,425
I love you!

325
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,845
We'll be happy, Lust.

326
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,465
No!

327
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:19,139
W...Why?

328
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:41,585
You are my little mistake.

329
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:44,305
Nothing more.

330
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,676
Where did I come from?

331
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,345
And where will I go?

332
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,605
Not for me to know.

333
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,215
Lujon!

334
00:21:03,921 --> 00:21:04,806
Lujun!

335
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,326
Lujon, are you here?

336
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,466
Where are you?

337
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:09,275
Answer me!

338
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:30,355
Hello?!

339
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,505
Lydia!

340
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:39,285
How could this be?

341
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,945
What is this?

342
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,190
Hey...

343
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,896
Hey..... Lust, I'm hungry.

344
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,365
Please, just one.

345
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,445
Lust!

346
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,112
Fullmetal Alchemist

347
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,936
Episode 36, The sinner within.

348
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:47,065
When people see my Automail,
they get scared because it's unknown.

349
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,105
I don't blame them
for that feeling.

350
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,225
But feelings
aren't always right.
