1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:02,740
I heard you on my way in here.

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:04,720
You say you're an agent of God.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,780
Well, then why don't you try passing
judgement on me?

4
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:12,580
That's Alex Louis Armstrong, the Strong
Arm Alchemist!

5
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,980
Don't pray just yet.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:19,375
You're facing the technique
that's been passed down the
Armstrong line for generations.

7
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,962
That's hardly a blessing!

8
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,557
Next shot!

9
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,890
It's true what you said.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,770
The opposite of creation is distraction,
and both must be served.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,510
Destroy and create!

12
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,570
It's the grand currency of the universe,
and it's the charge of the Armstrong’s to

13
00:00:46,571 --> 00:00:47,512
carry out both!

14
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,800
That's why I was going to track you down
once Full Metal and Crystal were finished.

15
00:00:59,450 --> 00:01:02,570
A unique combination of alchemy and
physical power.

16
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,190
God help me.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,990
If you have red irises, red eyes,
and brown skin, you must be from...

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,770
But the god your people kneel to forbids
alchemy.

19
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,949
It's modernity's greatest sin!

20
00:01:22,796 --> 00:01:24,096
I see your rationale.

21
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,370
Alchemy has three parts.

22
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,150
Determine the makeup, then break it down
and rebuild it as something else.

23
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:34,230
You stop at step two, so you're
saved by a loophole, like
killing for a religious cause.

24
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:37,330
But murder's murder, and you're still an
alchemist!

25
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:39,110
I only do as this arm instructs me.

26
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:43,887
Contrary or not, leave it to the prophets
to interpret God's will!

27
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,820
Humankind cannot gain anything without
first giving something in return.

28
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,520
To obtain, something of equal value must
be lost.

29
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,405
That is alchemy's first law of equivalent
exchange.

30
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,566
In those days, we really believed that to
be the world's one and only truth.

31
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:48,263
The Ishbal Massacre.

32
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,460
Brother, what are we gonna do now?

33
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,140
I don't know, Al.

34
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,853
Let's just get some distance from that guy
with the glasses.

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,262
Get down!

36
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:30,586
Ma'am, have you got a back door?

37
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,140
What about Eastern Command and the
Colonel?

38
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,660
Yeah, there's no way we can get there.

39
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,300
With the Brigadier General showing up like
that, I get the sense not even Mustang can

40
00:04:43,301 --> 00:04:44,480
protect Marcoh right now.

41
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,260
Oh, yeah.

42
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,520
All those people from Central are there.

43
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,700
Maybe you're right.

44
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,540
People from Central have been deployed
here?

45
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,200
Just the Fuhrer and his entourage,
yeah.

46
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,200
I don't understand.

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:55,960
Is this for me?

48
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,480
No, it's not like that.

49
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't worry.

50
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,210
Too slow!

51
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:06,890
That's no fair!

52
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,817
Just catch me.

53
00:05:11,892 --> 00:05:14,125
Lets play a new game, Priests and Dragons.

54
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,665
Yeah ok.

55
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,130
Too slow!

56
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:15,798
I can't do this.

57
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:17,356
I get to be the pocket watch.

58
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,745
I've run away
from it long enough.

59
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,530
I won't do it now.

60
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,190
I don't care if that man kills me.

61
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:22,470
This is the Village.

62
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:23,390
You go over there.

63
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:26,230
How can I, when it's something that I
deserve?

64
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,130
Wait for me!

65
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,390
Colonel, we found him!

66
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,240
Come on, talk to me, Major.

67
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,100
What happened?

68
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,020
Close call.

69
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,800
This is turning into a real mess.

70
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,860
That's a hell of an understatement.

71
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,800
What about Grand?

72
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,200
We found him on the road a few blocks up.

73
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's just say there'll be some
promotions, unless Ironblood can survive

74
00:06:04,441 --> 00:06:06,220
his brain turning into hamburger meat.

75
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,500
But he was the Brigadier General.

76
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,240
He was an expert in hand-to-hand,
right?

77
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,540
Scar's MO.

78
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,580
No doubt about it.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,680
That man... he's an Ishbalan.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,480
I'm sure of it.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,640
I saw his red eyes.

82
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,920
Just stay down.

83
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,420
You're hurt.

84
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,900
I'm sorry, Lieutenant Colonel.

85
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,440
You sent me with direct orders.

86
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,360
And I failed.

87
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,460
I hope Elric is okay.

88
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:38,740
But the brown skin and the red eyes... I
know the man chasing him is from Ishbal.

89
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,580
I even confronted him about his God.

90
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,340
Well, well.

91
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,760
There's a decent break in the case,
Hughes.

92
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,300
Now you know why he's killing us.

93
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,760
I'm missing the connection.

94
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,780
Why do you deserve death just because he's
from Ishbal?

95
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,540
The rebellion, right?

96
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:57,301
Ed told me Mustang was sad about that too.

97
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:58,745
But why?

98
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,100
Ishbal started that
war for independence.

99
00:07:01,366 --> 00:07:03,960
They lost lives, but so did the military.

100
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,620
If all of us fought for revenge every time
we lost a war, there'd be no end to it.

101
00:07:08,621 --> 00:07:10,060
It'd be a cycle without a point.

102
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,420
You're not listening.

103
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,900
That was no war.

104
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,487
It was a massacre.

105
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:23,510
The people of Ishbal are an ethnic tribe
in the East.

106
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,296
They worship Ishbala as the one and only
creator.

107
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,909
They draw from a different history, so they
see the world through a different lens.

108
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:34,150
Our world is sulfur and nitrogen,
science and math.

109
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,050
We believe everything can be explained
with numbers.

110
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,150
An equivalent exchange is our sacred
canon.

111
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:44,350
But to them, alchemy is a perversion of
the world God has given us.

112
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:48,090
The devil's miracle, corrupting man by
putting us in Ishbala's place.

113
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:55,930
As a result of this collision of views,
resistance movements would pop up from

114
00:07:55,931 --> 00:07:56,750
time to time.

115
00:07:59,410 --> 00:07:59,730
Hey!

116
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,610
What'd you do that for?

117
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:06,370
One day during a house inspection,
an officer in the military accidentally

118
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,250
shot and killed a Ishbalan child.

119
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:12,490
The incident became a rallying cry.

120
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,130
Massive riots and uprisings broke out all
over the region.

121
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,516
It was too much, too fast.

122
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:28,380
The military couldn't control its soldiers
in the chaos.

123
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,900
More fuel for the fire.

124
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,160
It escalated into a full-scale rebellion
that lasted seven years.

125
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,360
Until the Fuhrer had had enough.

126
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,140
He sent in the problem-solvers,
the state alchemists.

127
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,783
Why?

128
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,620
Because of their doctrines, the Ishbalans
have neither alchemists nor up-to-date

129
00:08:48,621 --> 00:08:49,100
weaponry.

130
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,180
Want them to demonize us even more?

131
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,915
You think that's a long-term answer?

132
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,391
Did you bring the materials?

133
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,840
I did, Colonel, but they're still under
research.

134
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,020
And like I told you, we don't need them.

135
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,727
Have you not seen the reports?

136
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,020
The resistance is growing.

137
00:09:03,021 --> 00:09:06,960
That's because your excessive use of force
is creating sympathizers.

138
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,836
It's easier for the Ishbalans to recruit
the other tribes.

139
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:10,419
Hehehehe.

140
00:09:10,465 --> 00:09:11,660
What are you trying to say?

141
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,792
That our Fuhrer's great cause is unjust?

142
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,035
We've lost several thousand men.

143
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,380
The civilian casualties are well beyond
that.

144
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,995
The whole country is unstable.

145
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:29,015
This isn't a humanitarian summit.

146
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,880
This is war.

147
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,560
Now turn them over, Crystal Alchemist.

148
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,790
That's an order.

149
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,260
Dominance in a bottle, men.

150
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:54,460
Alchemic augmentation.

151
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,575
It's my job to end this war quickly,
and with this, I can.

152
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,160
So what happened?

153
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,520
How did the Ishbalans respond to your
weapon?

154
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,720
They didn't.

155
00:10:07,874 --> 00:10:08,520
What?

156
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,140
Every gathering point of resistance the
state alchemists were sent to.

157
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
They were all wiped out in a single night.

158
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,721
That's him!

159
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,506
Over here!

160
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,511
No more running, Colonel.

161
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:13,316
Take him down.

162
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:15,570
Sir.

163
00:11:23,139 --> 00:11:24,152
My ankle.

164
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,340
Let me help you, son.

165
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,990
During the war, there were doctors who
would treat the wounded.

166
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:37,930
Didn't matter what side you're on,
Ishbalan of the state, if you were in

167
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:39,350
need of help, they would treat you.

168
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,558
How's that feel?

169
00:11:47,084 --> 00:11:47,624
Thanks

170
00:11:48,217 --> 00:11:48,957
I'm it.

171
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,279
However, they were casualties,
too.

172
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,140
Colonel Grand, what happened here?

173
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,500
This became an underground contact point
for Ishbalan insurgents.

174
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,488
These doctors were involved.

175
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,480
Involved?

176
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:14,600
They were treating them!

177
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,660
They were trying to save anyone they
could!

178
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,260
That's right.

179
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,850
And the ones they saved were coming back
to murder my soldiers.

180
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:40,650
Stop that!

181
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,670
You're a soldier following orders in a
time of war.

182
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:47,850
It's my soul that carries the sin.

183
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,550
These doctors gave everything in the name
of saving lives.

184
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,810
I mean well.

185
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,610
How can we ever make this bearable?

186
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,209
If I run away, will you keep quiet and let
me escape?

187
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,630
So I left with the Philosopher's Stones
and all the research that explained how to

188
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:09,170
create them.

189
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,290
But I acted much too late.

190
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:15,230
The people of Ishbal had largely been
exterminated.

191
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,221
I heard that our military let only a
handful survive.

192
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:19,670
It's grim, granted.

193
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:21,630
But that's no reason for him to come after
you.

194
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:23,570
He wants revenge.

195
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,327
What could be more legitimate?

196
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:28,530
He's dragging people in who had nothing to
do with it.

197
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,537
How can you talk about legitimacy?

198
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:32,830
He's a fraud.

199
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,050
He's on a tirade of personal vengeance,
and he hides behind this excuse of God's

200
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:38,490
will so he can claim it's noble.

201
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:45,175
Still, if someone took you away from me,
brother, I think I might do the same thing.

202
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,830
Isn't that equivalent exchange?

203
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,108
No!

204
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,990
That's not how the principle works.

205
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,190
Haven't you learned that yet?

206
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,770
Destroying lives doesn't bring lives back.

207
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,330
We all just need to live and be content
while we can.

208
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:05,841
Come here.

209
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:19,000
Dr. Marcoh, why don't you let us hide you
in our hometown for a while?

210
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,799
It's just three days on a train from here,
right?

211
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:24,600
It might be hard on us going back there,
though.

212
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,280
Not at all.

213
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,960
We have friends there, the Rockbells.

214
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,100
They make automail.

215
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,380
I'm sure they'll be...

216
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,280
Rockbell?

217
00:14:33,281 --> 00:14:34,280
No, I can't.

218
00:14:34,281 --> 00:14:35,416
I can't go there.

219
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,660
I'm sorry.

220
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,920
Dr. Marcoh, what...

221
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,390
Foolish troops.

222
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,990
Don't think you'll be spared.

223
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,433
You're all using weapons with alchemic
modifications.

224
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,570
God judges you!

225
00:15:03,329 --> 00:15:04,349
That's far enough.

226
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:05,725
Colonel Mustang, wait!

227
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,070
Colonel Mustang?

228
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,890
Flame Alchemist Roy Mustang?

229
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,190
The one and only.

230
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:10,910
But, sir!

231
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:13,370
I'm awfully sorry about your grievances.

232
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,070
But no one hurts my men.

233
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,710
Yet another soul who departs from God's
path.

234
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,090
Death will be swift.

235
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,630
Brave enough to attack the Flame
Alchemist, I'll make you a funeral pyre.

236
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:25,667
Colonel!

237
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,223
Stubborn man!

238
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,520
That's no way to get promoted,
Hawkeye.

239
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,380
Relax, sir.

240
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:39,336
I just saved your life.

241
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,960
Your flame attack's no good in the rain.

242
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,500
She has a point, Colonel.

243
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,107
Wet gloves can't make a spark.

244
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,660
Fire!

245
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,320
He's certainly a fast one.

246
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:54,980
After him.

247
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,320
Now!

248
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,880
Lieutenant Breda, go to the train station.

249
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,880
Wait for fullmetal.

250
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:00,600
But how do you know he's going there?

251
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:01,480
Isn't it obvious?

252
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,020
He's shielding Dr. Marcoh.

253
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,100
He'll try to get him out.

254
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,212
Marcoh, wait!

255
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,540
It's your call.

256
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,520
We don't have to go anywhere you don't
trust.

257
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,240
We're not trying to steal your research.

258
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,060
No, Ed.

259
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,800
There are other reasons I can't go there
with you.

260
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,620
I'm a stained man.

261
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,540
This time I have an attack made just for
you!

262
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,360
By clasping

263
00:16:43,401 --> 00:16:44,128
Al.

264
00:16:55,494 --> 00:16:59,810
By clasping your hands, you make an array
with your body and circulate
the alchemic reaction within.

265
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:04,490
I know your secret, and without this
sinful arm you can't transmute quickly.

266
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,874
That is your weakness.

267
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,711
BROTHER!!! 
No, brother!

268
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:22,710
Get up and run!

269
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:23,810
Get out of here!

270
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,220
I will give you a moment to pray.

271
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,834
Thanks for the gesture, but I don't
believe... Stopped a long time ago.

272
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,136
Back in the tunnel you told me you lost
your older brother.

273
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,480
Died in Ishbal, right?

274
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,740
Correct, Fullmetal.

275
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,383
He was killed by a State Alchemist.

276
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,800
Well, I'm the oldest brother.

277
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
So take my life and go.

278
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,700
That's an equivalent exchange,
don't you think?

279
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,640
No!

280
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,300
What are you talking about, brother?

281
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,980
You just said yourself that life doesn't
equal a life!

282
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,120
You stay out of this, Al!

283
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,060
I'm doing what's fair!

284
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,220
He's not a State Alchemist.

285
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,216
I should be enough!

286
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,000
I promise.

287
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,355
I promise before God I won't hurt your
brother.

288
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,700
But you should listen to him, Fullmetal.

289
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,071
Your life for another is not a fair
exchange.

290
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,440
There is nothing in this world that can
equal the loss of my brother and my people.

291
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,628
Nothing will make it easier to bear!

292
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,020
Really?

293
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:22,920
Then why are you murdering all these
people?

294
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:28,755
Brother,

295
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,680
what are you doing?

296
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,900
Get away from him!

297
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,300
Brother, run!

298
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,840
We're all we've got, remember?

299
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,786
We're all we've got!

300
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:38,970
I don't want this.

301
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:40,910
No!

302
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,189
Dr. Marcoh?

303
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,600
Don't you have any sense?

304
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,100
You should be long gone by now!

305
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:55,280
I investigated some ancient texts written
by your people in Ishbal.

306
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,200
I remember discovering the alchemic
drawing you have tattooed on your arm.

307
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,900
Maybe this has flaws, but it is a
philosopher's stone and sure enough your

308
00:19:03,901 --> 00:19:04,760
arm is responding.

309
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,720
Don't say it!

310
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,420
You know nothing!

311
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,660
It's some kind of reaction.

312
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,460
Dr. Marko, what's going on?

313
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,260
Is there a different way of using the
stone?

314
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,738
Aaaaaaaaaaaaah!

315
00:19:47,225 --> 00:19:48,865
The classic sewer escape.

316
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,830
Don't follow him.

317
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,230
Damn it, I was about to jump in.

318
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:52,695
Nice mess.

319
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:53,630
Is it over yet?

320
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,080
You know you can try to help while you're
here, Hughes.

321
00:19:56,105 --> 00:19:56,605
Lay off!

322
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,177
I'm as normal as they come
and this is a contest of freaks.

323
00:19:59,202 --> 00:20:00,270
What do you want me to do?

324
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,630
Fire my slingshot at him?

325
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:08,110
Lieutenant Hawkeye, take crowd control.

326
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,670
I don't want anyone getting close.

327
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:10,830
Yes, sir.

328
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,950
Say something, Al.

329
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,070
Are you still with me?

330
00:20:16,236 --> 00:20:17,116
You idiot!

331
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,350
What's that for?

332
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:21,550
Why didn't you run away when I told you
to?

333
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,851
Because steal for brains,
then he would have killed you!

334
00:20:23,876 --> 00:20:25,798
So you decided to die instead?

335
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,890
That's really smart.

336
00:20:26,891 --> 00:20:29,567
Don't call your older brother an idiot,
idiot!

337
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,630
That's not how we do things.

338
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,310
Live and be content while we can.

339
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,510
Live to research more alchemy so one day
we can get our bodies back.

340
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,723
That is how we do things, brother.

341
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,690
Dying, and dying by yourself, and leaving
me on my own?

342
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:47,024
That's something I won't let you do.

343
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,260
Oh, this is perfect!

344
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,147
Now my arm's falling off, too!

345
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,962
Today is a terrible day!

346
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:57,156
We're really falling apart at the seams,
aren't we?

347
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,995
Everyone who sees us must think we're a
joke.

348
00:21:01,396 --> 00:21:03,016
But we're alive, right?

349
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:06,450
Yeah, we are that, Al.

350
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:09,770
A hollow suit of armor.

351
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,150
We've never seen a soul transmutation that
actually worked.

352
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,790
Yeah, they must have risked their lives to
make it possible.

353
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:18,630
What do you think makes the bond between
those two so strong?

354
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,090
Colonel, the Fuhrer's secretary has
arrived.

355
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,170
Has she really?

356
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,210
And what does she want?

357
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,330
I have orders to take Marcoh into Fuhrer
Bradley's custody.

358
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:31,030
He assures you that the doctor will not
come to harm you.

359
00:21:31,203 --> 00:21:31,503
What?

360
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:33,700
Yes, of course.

361
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,450
Marcoh, don't!

362
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:37,070
It's like I told you, Ed.

363
00:21:37,071 --> 00:21:37,910
I can't go with you.

364
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,930
Your hometown is not a place where I could
ever be welcome.

365
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,003
Why not?

366
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:44,950
The two doctors that we executed in
Ishbal.

367
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,670
Their names were Rockbell.

368
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,620
Let's get going, sir.

369
00:22:03,621 --> 00:22:03,921
Yeah.

370
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,920
Brother, I think I just heard Mom's voice.

371
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,000
Come on, Al.

372
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,380
You just had a brush with death.

373
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,820
Don't go unstable on me now.

374
00:23:38,098 --> 00:23:39,898
Full Metal Alchemist.

375
00:23:39,923 --> 00:23:41,129
Episode 16.

376
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:42,816
That which is lost.

377
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,175
Equivalent exchange.

378
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:46,510
Brother's arm and leg?

379
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:47,650
My body?

380
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,610
We lost them, but what have we gained?
