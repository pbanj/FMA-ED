1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,820
I couldn't believe it.

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,880
Come on, eat something.

3
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,420
You need to eat to get
your strength back, right?

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:21,760
Fine, suit yourself.

5
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:25,436
I don't know why I have to take
care of this stubborn mule anyway.

6
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,676
Hey, is there
anywhere that still hurts?

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,091
I could bring you some medicine.

8
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,080
Has his condition improved?

9
00:00:40,581 --> 00:00:42,516
He just won't listen
to anything I tell him.

10
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,420
We try to help him and he
just leaves and gets hurt again.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,080
Those of us who have the blood of Ishbal running through
our veins are protected by our god, Isbala, up above.

12
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,500
Everything has happened
as God designed.

13
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:12,836
What's wrong?

14
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,140
Not joining in?

15
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,060
Of course I am!

16
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,316
Isn't that why you hired me?

17
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm going to slice through their
flesh and bathe in their blood!

18
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:35,356
Yes, slaughter them all!

19
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:36,780
Spare no one!

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:50,390
What is this?

21
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,550
More suffering?

22
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,006
Is Ishbala sending
us yet another trial?

23
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,070
No.

24
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:58,230
This is not the will of God.

25
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,830
These are deeds wrought only
by soulless and wicked men.

26
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,110
No!

27
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,890
You're not strong enough!

28
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,550
Ishbala...

29
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,150
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,830
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

31
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:22,370
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

32
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:29,370
In those days, we really believed
that to be the worlds one and only truth.

33
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,190
A while back in Risembool, there
was something you wanted to tell me,

34
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,270
but you couldn't.

35
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,606
You said you were
afraid of how I'd react.

36
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,230
You remember that, don't you?

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:18,070
I can't remember parts of my
past because they never happened.

38
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:20,266
My memories and
my soul are fake.

39
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,550
Something you created.

40
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,390
Isn't that what
you wanted to say?

41
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,230
No, what Ed wanted to tell
you was that... Stop lying to me!

42
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:31,010
Is there anything else you're
hiding? that you want to say?

43
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:33,310
What about you,
my so-called brother?

44
00:04:33,410 --> 00:04:34,626
Answer my question.

45
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:35,990
Why won't you say anything?

46
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,390
Unless it's true!

47
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,122
Why didn't you say anything Ed?

48
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,360
If I'm nothing more than a bunch of
made-up memories, then what do I do now?

49
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,884
No, really. 
I mean I covered....

50
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,850
If I'm just made-up, then that
means Mom could be made-up too.

51
00:05:14,405 --> 00:05:16,405
Stop!
Thief!

52
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,670
Somebody stop them!

53
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,066
You little Bratz!

54
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:21,890
Get back here!

55
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,510
Nobody steals from me!

56
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:36,170
We lost him.

57
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:38,306
Here, eat up.

58
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,650
I don't want any!

59
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,910
What were you thinking?

60
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,086
You just picked that up
and stole it out of nowhere!

61
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,950
If Mom knew we were...

62
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,150
There, see?

63
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:49,070
You can't be so
hard on yourself.

64
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,890
You shouldn't take things
that don't belong to you.

65
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:53,250
Did you hear that?

66
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:55,230
This old pile of
junk said something.

67
00:05:55,745 --> 00:05:58,450
No, I'm not a pile of junk.

68
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,291
Hey, you guys look like...

69
00:06:03,815 --> 00:06:05,350
Are you from Ishbal?

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,286
Uh...

71
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,520
Um, excuse me.

72
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,080
Have you seen anyone
that looks like this?

73
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,100
Hmmm, no.

74
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,060
I'm sorry, I haven't.

75
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, well, thank you.

76
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,016
Don't worry.

77
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,200
As soon as we find him, you can talk to
him and set him straight on everything.

78
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,820
Edward?

79
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:29,000
Winry, I'm scared.

80
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,080
There is something I've
wanted to ask him for a long time.

81
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,100
But I've always been too
afraid to talk to him about it.

82
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,160
What is it?

83
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:41,780
Oh, no...

84
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,100
Please Al, I... don't...

85
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:49,455
Edward,

86
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,080
Sometimes the answers never
come if you don't ask the questions.

87
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,700
It must seem very bizarre to find so
many people living in a place like this.

88
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,896
No, not at all.

89
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,980
It's just not what I was
expecting when I followed them.

90
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,316
Don't worry about it.

91
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,420
I guess these two were causing
some trouble on the surface.

92
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,440
By the way, where did you get
that strange armor you're wearing?

93
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,900
Is it some kind of uniform?

94
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,520
Relax, he's not
part of the military.

95
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,580
Scar!

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,860
Our paths entwine.

97
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,940
Don't they, Alphonse Elric?

98
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,400
I didn't know you
would be here, too.

99
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,470
Well, do you two
know each other, then?

100
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,130
We do.

101
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,970
In a sense.

102
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,270
Perfect, that makes this easier.

103
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,030
Stranger... I ask that you do not tell
anyone about us or this camp of ours.

104
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,470
I won't.

105
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:07,230
I promise.

106
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:10,590
I've heard about what
happened in Ishbal.

107
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,630
But why did you end up here?

108
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:16,670
Because the military
came and attacked us.

109
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,490
Yes.

110
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,930
They've destroyed our homes and massacred
our people again and again, but they do not tire.

111
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,950
They still just keep coming.

112
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:28,630
If those wretched State Alchemists
are indeed still trying to hunt me down,

113
00:08:28,631 --> 00:08:32,030
then right now might be
their only chance to succeed.

114
00:08:33,245 --> 00:08:34,550
Because you're injured.

115
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:37,110
What happened to your brother?

116
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:41,010
I don't care what
happens to him.

117
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,180
What, Rick?

118
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,300
What's wrong?

119
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,380
Mom's locket.

120
00:08:49,381 --> 00:08:49,996
It fell off.

121
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,580
It's gone.

122
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,340
Who cares about that
dumb old thing anyway?

123
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,300
Just forget about it, all right?

124
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,300
When I fell...

125
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,696
Hey, wait!

126
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,500
Wait for me!

127
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,640
You can't!

128
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,140
Somebody might see you!

129
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,876
Rick!

130
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:05,580
Leo!

131
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,920
Don't worry.

132
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,020
I'll bring them back.

133
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,060
I don't know what
happened, Alphonse Elric.

134
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,420
But if you and your brother hate each other now,
then that makes things a great deal easier for me.

135
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,540
Scar, what do you
think about me?

136
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:30,180
I mean, when we're
talking, do you...

137
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,020
Do you sense anything?

138
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,840
Do you think I'm human,
even with this body?

139
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,470
What do we have here?

140
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,290
A pair of Ishbalans.

141
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,630
Stinking rats.

142
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,486
Come on, Rick.

143
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,126
Give it up.

144
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,590
You're never gonna find it.

145
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,000
Is this what you're looking for?

146
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,190
Hello?

147
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,170
Yes.

148
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,190
Oh, is that so?

149
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,090
Yes, by all means, follow them.

150
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:20,890
Find their little nest.

151
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:26,610
So, that locket used
to belong to your mom?

152
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:27,630
Uh-huh.

153
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,670
What's inside of it?

154
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:30,666
I don't know.

155
00:10:30,690 --> 00:10:32,366
It's broken and won't open.

156
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,370
But that's okay.

157
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,190
Get rid of that thing, will ya?

158
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,470
No way!

159
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,790
You shouldn't talk like that about
something that was your mom's.

160
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,970
Oh, that's really funny,
you calling her a mother.

161
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,386
All she ever did
was force rules on us.

162
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,990
She was never nice
around us, not even once.

163
00:10:47,991 --> 00:10:50,206
She was just
trying to protect you.

164
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,186
She loved you.

165
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:51,930
No!

166
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,406
She never loved us!

167
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:55,110
We didn't mean squat to her!

168
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,410
It's strange.

169
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:11,650
It seems like he would do
anything to forget about his past.

170
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,630
The exact opposite of me.

171
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:17,450
I want to get my memories back.

172
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,550
My real memories, if I have any.

173
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,800
Okay, you two go in first.

174
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,760
Wait a second.

175
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,680
Okay, it's clear.

176
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,175
Batard!

177
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,576
Let him go!

178
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,240
Now!

179
00:12:05,364 --> 00:12:05,964
Stop!

180
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:17,810
Yes.

181
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:18,790
Yes.

182
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:19,830
Right.

183
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,230
I understand.

184
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,486
Thank you.

185
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,086
Wait, Al?

186
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,730
Where are you?

187
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,910
What are you trying to do?

188
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,140
So, they were mercenaries.

189
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah, they're using an old military
installation on the outskirts of the city.

190
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,760
That's where Rick
should be, too.

191
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:39,196
But Scar, are you sure
we should be doing this?

192
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,580
I mean, it's going to
be kind of dangerous.

193
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:44,220
Hey, do you have some kind of
problem with us coming along?

194
00:12:44,821 --> 00:12:45,895
No, it's uh...

195
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,660
You have to realize stranger, nothing is stronger
 to an Ishbalan than faith and his loyalty to his kin.

196
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,376
If the life of an old man can help
save the boy, then I will freely give it up.

197
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,640
He's right.

198
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,700
Ishbalans protect their own without
hesitation, no matter what the cost is.

199
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,280
Except...

200
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,596
Except for Mom.

201
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,780
She flat-out abandoned us.

202
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,600
Really?

203
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,616
You heard from Al?

204
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,096
Yeah.

205
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,760
And I think he may be involved
in something very strange.

206
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,820
I remember how it
happened perfectly.

207
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,820
Mom was praying to
Ishbala like she always did.

208
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,160
Rick, are you sleeping?

209
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,520
I never told Rick
what really happened.

210
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,740
But I promised myself that
nothing would ever hurt him.

211
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,320
Because I would protect him.

212
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,940
Over there.

213
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:27,960
The military is going to give
us a huge reward for this job.

214
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
Then we can sit back and relax.

215
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,320
We captured one of those children
just like you ordered us to, boss.

216
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,536
Are you sure
they'll take the bait?

217
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,340
Of course they will.

218
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,360
He's one of their
own people, right?

219
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:45,380
But more importantly, the armored guy
and the scarred one will come along, too.

220
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,700
So he's an Alchemist, huh?

221
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,940
Get him!

222
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,840
always love it when I'm right.

223
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,380
You and the others
take care of the tin can.

224
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,940
This one's all mine.

225
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,540
Scar!

226
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,540
So, we meet
again, little brother.

227
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,380
What are you doing here?

228
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,656
Why bother fighting?

229
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,160
You're not real.

230
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,357
Just a collection of
fabricated memories.

231
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:40,680
Once I've put you out of your misery, you won't
have to worry about what's real and what's fake.

232
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,560
Wont that be nice!

233
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,740
You leave him alone!

234
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:58,480
Brother, what are you doing here?

235
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,626
That's a stupid question.

236
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:01,540
We've been worried
sick about you.

237
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,445
He's been looking for
you all over Central.

238
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:05,880
Brother.

239
00:16:10,204 --> 00:16:10,804
Fire!

240
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:19,120
Al, all this time I've
been too afraid to ask you.

241
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,860
But I need to know
the truth, okay?

242
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,520
It's my fault you don't
have a real body anymore.

243
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,820
Do you hate me?

244
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,660
What?

245
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,280
Do you?

246
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,560
I wouldn't blame
you if you did Al.

247
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,616
But I've gotta know.

248
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,140
Do you hate me for
all that's happened?

249
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:40,340
That's what you've
been trying to ask me?

250
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,096
Al!

251
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,180
Behind you!

252
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,400
Brother!

253
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,860
I can never... I
can never hate you!

254
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,430
What?

255
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:29,590
I'm not dead.

256
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,850
I guess even a murderer with a reputation like
he has can make a mistake if he's in enough pain.

257
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,450
Shoot!

258
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,790
Somebody shoot him!

259
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,230
Time to give up.

260
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,990
It looks like you're the
only one who's left here.

261
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,330
Who the hell are you?

262
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,526
A dog of the
military just like you.

263
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,826
You're a State Alchemist?

264
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,026
But that doesn't make sense!

265
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,070
We're on the.... the same side!

266
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,390
Well, this is a surprise.

267
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,510
A real State Alchemist.

268
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,090
Please allow me to thank
you for making me look like this!

269
00:18:20,245 --> 00:18:21,496
Ssss... Stop it!

270
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,120
Get off me.

271
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,444
Get off.

272
00:18:34,668 --> 00:18:35,468
Rick!

273
00:18:36,892 --> 00:18:37,492
No.....

274
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,116
Rick!

275
00:18:47,165 --> 00:18:49,165
No Rick you can't.

276
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:50,330
Please, no!

277
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,600
Rick?

278
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,950
It's Mom's locket.

279
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:06,170
She saved me, see?

280
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,990
Hmm.

281
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:14,410
Oh, this is eye medicine.

282
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,450
Medicine?

283
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:20,130
Evidently your mother suffered from
an eye disease that leads to blindness,

284
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:24,910
but as our people do, she pretended to be
fine so that you boys wouldn't have to worry.

285
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:31,590
Come to think of it, she once told me how hard it
was to care for you because of some condition she had.

286
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,950
But I'll bet it was harder
on her on the inside.

287
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:37,630
Our mother couldn't see, Rick.

288
00:19:37,810 --> 00:19:39,270
That means...

289
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,350
Rick, Leo where are you?
I can't find you!

290
00:19:48,374 --> 00:19:50,374
Wh...
[Screams]

291
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,540
She... she was looking for us.

292
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,274
She ran into our room to find us and
protect us from the soldiers, and that's when.

293
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,880
Oh, no!

294
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,756
What the hell's going on?

295
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,560
I was working for the military!

296
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,980
So why did that damn state
Alchemist interfere with us?

297
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,256
Does the Führer
even know about this!

298
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,660
Because maybe I should
give him a phone ca.....

299
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,880
So where will all of you go now?

300
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:41,440
There's another group of our people living
and hiding free from the state, just like us.

301
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,320
We'll travel downstream
until we reach them.

302
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,120
Al, thank you for everything.

303
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,420
Now when I think about my mother, I'm going
to treasure every single memory that I have.

304
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,260
Yeah, me too.

305
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,640
And from now on, I'll
know my memories are real.

306
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,460
I'll have faith in that.

307
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,780
Alphonse Elric.

308
00:20:59,781 --> 00:21:03,340
Earlier, I did sense something.

309
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,140
Tears that can't
be seen, but felt.

310
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:11,240
Those tears were... human.

311
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,580
Thank you.

312
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,900
Hey Scar, so tell me something.

313
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,820
Did the Ishbalan people ever
possess the Philosopher's Stone?

314
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,896
Is that the real truth?

315
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,196
And then the
military came after it?

316
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,220
No, Ed.

317
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,160
It's the other way around.

318
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:31,276
We wanted the stone to keep the military
from wiping out our race and our way of life.

319
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,840
But did you create one?

320
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,380
A Philosopher's Stone?

321
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,160
Let's get going.

322
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,760
Hey, hold on.

323
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,440
I want an answer!

324
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,240
Brother, let him go.

325
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,816
Those people need Scar.

326
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,860
He can help them.

327
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,780
Al, let's get going.

328
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:00,880
Right.

329
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,800
You know, Al,
I've been thinking.

330
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,656
We used to fight over the
dumbest things, didn't we?

331
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,200
Yeah.

332
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,680
Like, who got to
sleep in the top bunk.

333
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,680
I remember.

334
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,080
I lost that one.

335
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,800
Or what about that time
we fought over the toys?

336
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,500
I won.

337
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,940
We used to fight
over candy, too, right?

338
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,760
Hey, I never won any of them.

339
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,370
Fullmetal Alchemist.

340
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,140
Episode 25.

341
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,980
Words of Farewell.

342
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,460
Let's leave.

343
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,880
Let's go and not tell
anyone where we're headed.

344
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,300
That's the way
we've always done it.
