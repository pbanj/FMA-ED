1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,440
Disguarding two.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:06,780
Geez, more junk.

3
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,280
Just discard already!

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,500
Sorry, I'll take two as well.

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:17,040
Holy!

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,160
Hey, brother, wanna
double the bet?

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,320
Suit yourself.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,660
Sorry, I've got a whole house.

9
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,700
I'm sorry too.

10
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,460
Royal flesh.

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:29,960
No way!

12
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:32,420
I thought for sure
I'd win for once.

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,740
Okay, this time
I'm gonna... I quit.

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:35,560
I'm bored.

15
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:36,240
Bored?

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,260
Bored of what?

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:37,920
Winning?

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,380
You haven't lost yet.

19
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,740
Why don't you lose
on purpose for a while?

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,540
It's not about the cards, Al.

21
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,900
It's who we gotta see.

22
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:45,980
Mustang.

23
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,760
You don't wanna meet with him?

24
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,300
Of course I don't, Al!

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,020
Our best lead on the
stone turned out to be fake.

26
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,800
All this searching, we've
got nothing to show for it.

27
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,240
But we've done lots of good.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,040
Good?

29
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:02,060
Good goes on a military report
and a sidebar for collateral damage.

30
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,940
I can see his face.

31
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,840
His sarcastic little quips.

32
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,400
Just thinking about it...

33
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,320
makes me completely nauseous.

34
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,280
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,960
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

36
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,480
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

37
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:33,960
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,080
Are you sure it's okay to stop?

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,480
We're supposed to
go straight to East City.

40
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,540
It's right on the way.

41
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,220
Maybe we'll find something about the
Philosopher's Stone and avoid a lecture.

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,180
Besides, Aquroya's
a tourist hotspot.

43
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,060
I've always wanted
to check it out.

44
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,240
Feels kind of like we're
playing hooky, don't you think?

45
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,860
Stop being so...

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,340
What do we have here?

47
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,860
What an oddly
good hand of cards.

48
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,200
Ed, you cheater!

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,080
Come back.

50
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,920
I want everything
you won for me.

51
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,900
And I thought I
was just unlucky.

52
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,160
Keep running, gentlemen!

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,980
I want zero mistakes!

54
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,640
Tonight is the
night we catch her!

55
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,910
Finally, a dead end, Psiren.

56
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,090
Can't walk on water.

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,820
What are you waiting for, boys?

58
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,440
No!

59
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:47,430
It is a beautiful
city, isn't it?

60
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,210
I'll say.

61
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:52,530
Aquroya, the city of water
and perennial tourist magnet.

62
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,630
It sure beats the heck out of that East
City Dust Bowl and having to see the

63
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,490
colonels know-it-all
grin, don't you think?

64
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:01,250
What the hell's
your problem, pal?

65
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,810
Well, it is the city of water.

66
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:08,170
Ugh.

67
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:10,690
Hey, shouldn't we talk first?

68
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,490
You're coming to the station.

69
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,910
I got some questions
for you, alchemist.

70
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:23,270
So, you're telling me you're with the
state and that you're the famous full

71
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:24,890
metal hero of the people.

72
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:27,090
How many times do I
have to say it, Chief?

73
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,530
That watch should
be proof enough.

74
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,270
Sure, if it's real.

75
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,570
But I have my doubts.

76
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,410
I say you're too
short for a hero.

77
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,030
Why do you call him so small?

78
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,219
You want to crunch like an ant!

79
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,310
Brother, please.

80
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,550
He didn't say
anything like that.

81
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,510
Sorry for the third degree, kid.

82
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,470
Had to test you.

83
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,270
We've got a thief on our backs named
Psiren and we're all a little on edge.

84
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,230
Psiren?

85
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:48,890
Yeah.

86
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,110
Real name's unknown.

87
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,530
Only lead we got is
she uses alchemy.

88
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,610
So I thought you just
might be connected.

89
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:56,470
Hmm...

90
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,130
But you say you're
with the state.

91
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,170
And the full metal
alchemist, no less.

92
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,510
Damn that guy.

93
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,330
He kept saying the same
things for three hours straight.

94
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:09,090
He probably wears that hat
to hide the hole in his brain.

95
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,710
Stu, doesn't it concern you?

96
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,050
A criminal using
alchemy to steal?

97
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:14,730
Oh, crud.

98
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,030
Brother, you don't look so good.

99
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,050
My stomach feels...

100
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:27,790
Well, it looks like a little bit
of food poisoning, that's all.

101
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,310
It's not from eating too much?

102
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,250
Oh, shut up.

103
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,704
We'll need to give
you an injection.

104
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,390
Clara?

105
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:33,730
Injection?

106
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:35,490
Yeah, just a poke.

107
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:36,310
Ah!

108
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,190
Get away from me!

109
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,770
I don't need it!

110
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,770
Just a little needle
and you'll be fine.

111
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:41,751
Yeah, I feel better.

112
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:43,379
Don't be be a baby.

113
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,250
Take off your coat.

114
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,170
I hate you, Al.

115
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,900
Why do you want to sell
it to your own brother?

116
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:47,670
You're evil!

117
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:48,651
You don't mean that.

118
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:49,990
I'll turn you all into fish!

119
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:54,690
There.

120
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,430
You're all done, Ed.

121
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,270
That didn't hurt at all, did it?

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,390
Fast work.

123
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,130
You didn't even notice.

124
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,390
And after all that fuss...
Yeah, so what's your point?

125
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,590
We all have to grow
up sometime, right?

126
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,623
So, is the rude
commentary included in the bill?

127
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,090
She was so good at her job.

128
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:16,050
Smart.

129
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,790
And gorgeous, too.

130
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,130
I can't stop thinking about her.

131
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:22,950
You've got the weirdest
taste in women, Al.

132
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:25,110
She was a bad gift
and pretty wrapping.

133
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:26,910
That won't do, Mrs. Crabney.

134
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:28,870
You can't get better
on an empty stomach.

135
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:29,930
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,970
I just can't get it down.

137
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,030
It hurts my teeth.

138
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:36,530
Well, that bread's
too tough, isn't it?

139
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,470
We'll have to make
you something tastier.

140
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,230
You all right with that, Ed?

141
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,690
Of course.

142
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:45,585
Just give me a minute.

143
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,710
That looks dangerous.

144
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,130
Let me do it, brother.

145
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,090
You'll hurt yourself.

146
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:49,950
I'm fine.

147
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,490
Back off!

148
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,290
There we go.

149
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,250
Why don't you boys eat it?

150
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,830
You still with me, Al?

151
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:10,490
Yeah.

152
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:10,950
Sorry.

153
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,130
I was just thinking.

154
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,570
That Nurse Clara?

155
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,650
There's something really giving.

156
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,070
Calming about her.

157
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,810
She kind of reminds me of Mom.

158
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,130
Don't be ridiculous.

159
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,550
That woman's nothing like her.

160
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,070
I've gotten so clumsy.

161
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,830
Don't worry about it.

162
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,170
It's just a piece of fruit.

163
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,070
Good as new.

164
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:42,830
You're alchemists.

165
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,410
I didn't realize that.

166
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,450
Mr. Elric!

167
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:47,370
Mr. Elric!

168
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,550
Let's make a tape
saying I'm innocent.

169
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,170
You can play it
back all you want.

170
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,470
I know you are.

171
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:52,850
I know.

172
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,510
And this time I'm
asking you for a favor.

173
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:01,890
Officers, presenting State
Alchemist Master Edward Elric.

174
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,430
Salute!

175
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:03,890
Jeez.

176
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:06,790
So, what do you want?

177
00:09:07,090 --> 00:09:08,950
First, I want to
apologize for earlier.

178
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,930
All those questions.

179
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,250
I did what you said, sir.

180
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,850
I got in touch with Colonel Mustang
at the Eastern Command Center.

181
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,550
I paid long distance
and everything.

182
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,090
He sounded nice.

183
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,430
Angry, but nice.

184
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,930
He said you really
are a State Alchemist.

185
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,310
I sure pegged you wrong.

186
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,110
Like I said.

187
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:25,690
Yes, indeed, sir.

188
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,990
In light of this new information,
I wanted to ask you...

189
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,010
I'll need more.

190
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,490
As much as you like.

191
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,490
This is it.

192
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,630
Psiren's next Mark.

193
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,170
With you on our side, that thief's
hold on this city will finally unravel.

194
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,230
Yeah.

195
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,870
I'll do whatever I can tonight.

196
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:45,870
But that's a lot of people.

197
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:48,010
A lot of ways for
things to go wrong.

198
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,350
That's Psiren's M.O.

199
00:09:49,351 --> 00:09:52,070
Most thieves don't announce
their heists before they happen.

200
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,130
Psiren tells every
paper in the country.

201
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,690
Journalists, thrill-seekers,
even Psiren groupies flock to see.

202
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,350
It's become a spectator sport.

203
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,250
It is quite a following.

204
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,770
Well, the stardom ends tonight.

205
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,030
It's amazing how quick your popularity
fades when you're wearing stripes.

206
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,950
I'm going to check
the security station.

207
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm kind of surprised
you took this job.

208
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,580
Guess I'm just curious.

209
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,100
Yet another way to use
alchemy to do wrong.

210
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,660
Clever move.

211
00:10:37,507 --> 00:10:38,354
Come on Al.

212
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:49,599
Hey
hold it

213
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:04,200
Alchemy's the greatest thing
we humans have going for us.

214
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,600
And yet here you are stealing with
it and making things even worse.

215
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,780
Not to mention I put up with a very
mindnumbing interrogation because of you.

216
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,140
I'd say you owe
me a major apology.

217
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:34,870
You've just been pinned, Psiren.

218
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,110
I didn't mean that!

219
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:42,510
You've never fought with
a woman before, have you?

220
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:44,870
Makes for a whole
new style of action.

221
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:49,570
Err!

222
00:11:51,022 --> 00:11:52,710
Hey!
That was a dirty trick!

223
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,610
It's a shame I can't
show you my face.

224
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,590
It's a real treat.

225
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,710
Sleep tight, pipsqueak.

226
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,950
Who are you calling a pipsqueak?

227
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,750
You know I'd be
tall too in heels.

228
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:08,070
Al.

229
00:12:08,071 --> 00:12:08,550
Al!

230
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,870
You'd think I could keep track
of a seven foot suit of armor.

231
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:32,970
You.

232
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,690
What a surprise.

233
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,970
The kind nurse is really Psiren.

234
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,450
Or do all women here
have tattoos on their chests?

235
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,990
I... I don't know what you mean.

236
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,950
But I can't talk.

237
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,590
I just came in to
get some medicine.

238
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,070
Right.

239
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,050
And medicine that you
manufacture using alchemy.

240
00:12:48,051 --> 00:12:49,970
Now drop the act,
you lying fraud.

241
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,090
Come on now, little man.

242
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,190
Who's telling lies?

243
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,190
I did say that I was
beautiful under the mask.

244
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:58,150
That's hardly the point!

245
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:58,687
Brother?

246
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,410
Brother, bad news.

247
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,290
Is something wrong?

248
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,770
What do you think, Al?

249
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:06,770
Look at her!

250
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,390
That nurse you
thought was so great?

251
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,490
She's Psiren!

252
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,790
The transmutation
circle's proof enough!

253
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,190
The world isn't black
and white like you think.

254
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,210
You kids are too
young to understand.

255
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,030
A lot can happen.

256
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:19,170
Please!

257
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:20,770
I understand.

258
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,270
I just found out.

259
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:26,510
This hospital's scheduled
to be demolished.

260
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,350
Clara, you became a thief out
of necessity and compassion.

261
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,810
You're trying to save
this place, aren't you?

262
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,510
Yeah, that's right.

263
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:40,090
You think I like this, flinching
at every passing patrol.

264
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,370
But this hospital needs
money for all its patients.

265
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,590
I needed to...

266
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:46,990
See, Ed?

267
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:49,010
I told you she had heart.

268
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,610
Just like Mom.

269
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:51,810
Mr. Elric!

270
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:52,630
Mr. Elric!

271
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:54,170
A new notice from Psiren!

272
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:57,270
Am I interrupting something?

273
00:13:58,790 --> 00:13:59,650
Mr. Elric?

274
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,890
Looks like you've got
less security this time.

275
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,310
Yeah.

276
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,050
Psiren's made mules of
my men too many times.

277
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,299
I'm trying something different.

278
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,850
We've got a little trap rigged up in
that mansion right next to her target.

279
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:13,090
A trap?

280
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,830
Don't worry, you'll
see it soon enough.

281
00:14:14,843 --> 00:14:17,290
No one will call our force
incompetent anymore.

282
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,930
I'll hang her little
suit over my desk.

283
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:20,870
But stick around.

284
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,530
We'll need you if
anything goes wrong.

285
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,990
What are you going to do?

286
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,420
Now what?

287
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,190
Thanks, kid.

288
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,930
It was a good break.

289
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,050
Why'd you help?

290
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,610
It's nothing personal.

291
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,070
I wasn't helping you.

292
00:15:12,071 --> 00:15:15,810
I know a little about bending the
rules sometimes to do what's right.

293
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,510
It was for the hospital.

294
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,510
What's so funny?

295
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:20,610
Nothing.

296
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:22,870
You just sounded so grown-up.

297
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,450
I am grown-up, okay?

298
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,310
Is that so?

299
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:30,810
Well, as a grown-up woman,
I always repay my favors.

300
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:34,550
Is there something you'd like me to
do for you, Mr. All-Grown-Up Man?

301
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,830
Actually, there is one thing.

302
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,430
You're a savvy alchemist.

303
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,174
You must have heard of
the Philosopher's Stone.

304
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:44,490
I want you to tell me
anything that you know about it.

305
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,430
I have to get it, no matter
what or how long it takes.

306
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,590
Sorry, Edward.

307
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:52,350
I can't help you with that.

308
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,790
But how about this?

309
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,910
If you ever do figure out where a stone is,
tell me and I'll be happy to steal it for you.

310
00:16:03,528 --> 00:16:04,155
Hey.

311
00:16:05,491 --> 00:16:07,750
I'm happy that you can
do this for the hospital.

312
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:09,630
Yeah.

313
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,110
Thanks to you, Ed.

314
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,530
What's going on here?

315
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,630
Don't tell me that
Flake tricked us.

316
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,750
That couldn't be.

317
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:23,690
Claire's the last person who
would do something like that.

318
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:25,150
This has to be a mistake.

319
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,270
The only mistake here is inside
that metal skull of yours, Al.

320
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,990
She's robbed you of your senses
and played you like a freaking harp.

321
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:31,999
Don't say that, Brother.

322
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,090
You know what'll happen.

323
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,730
Brothers shouldn't argue.

324
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,630
It's simple.

325
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:41,980
Imagining this?

326
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:42,880
Wish you were.

327
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,600
It's terrible about
the hospital.

328
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,680
I tried to save it, but I
couldn't get the money in time.

329
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,940
I was devastated.

330
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,440
The guilt was too much.

331
00:16:52,441 --> 00:16:53,640
I didn't know how to go on.

332
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,460
So I became a nun.

333
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,560
Boring, Clara.

334
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,760
Yeah, I bet.

335
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,100
It's the truth, Ed.

336
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,280
But those who do
believe will be saved.

337
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,500
The Great Lord has told me
there are other places that need me.

338
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:06,880
Like this convent
we're standing in.

339
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,320
It's scheduled to
be demolished, too.

340
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,200
I only pray I can help.

341
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,440
You'll do it, Clara.

342
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,900
You just need to
try harder this time.

343
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
We'll help however we can.

344
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,100
Brother, more news!

345
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Yeah, what is it?

346
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,260
They're saying
Psiren struck again.

347
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,040
The whole city's in an uproar.

348
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:25,980
She did it!

349
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,720
The convent is gonna be saved!

350
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,920
It has to be a mistake.

351
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:37,860
Maybe she couldn't find someone to sell
what she... Have your brains turned to mush?

352
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:39,080
She's a con artist, Al.

353
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,700
She's been snowing
us for a good laugh.

354
00:17:40,701 --> 00:17:42,920
The only saving she's
doing is in her bank account!

355
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,952
Don't start that again.

356
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,100
That's not how she is!

357
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:47,040
Do I need to put you
two boys in a corner?

358
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:47,820
Ah!

359
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:51,785
Wait!

360
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,440
And which dress-up doll outfit
are you wearing today, Clara?

361
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:54,960
I know!

362
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,400
You're a schoolteacher, right?

363
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,540
You're working for a school that's about to be
shut down, and this time you won't be too late.

364
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,820
Isn't that right, Clara?

365
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:02,480
Isn't it?

366
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,720
You guessed it.

367
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,360
But maybe we shouldn't
talk about it with the K.I.D.s.

368
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,300
Like you care.

369
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,880
Stop jerking us around.

370
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:10,680
What are you?

371
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,089
You really.

372
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,720
Nothing but a thief, after all.

373
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:16,740
A common criminal who uses
alchemy for her own selfish gains.

374
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,240
That's a very good question, Ed.

375
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:25,180
But as I tell my children, students,
the best answers we find on our own.

376
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:32,930
Extra!

377
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:33,450
Extra!

378
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,670
Phantom Thief Psiren announces
her next big time Mark!

379
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,090
Why do you people
buy into that junk?

380
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,402
She's nothing but a thief
who's feeding off the attention.

381
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,790
What are you talking about?

382
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,530
We owe Psiren for
saving this place.

383
00:18:44,531 --> 00:18:45,970
Attention's the
least we can give.

384
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,810
She's Aquroya's Star of Hope.

385
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,190
You're gonna have to
explain that one to me.

386
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,330
We're the City of Water.

387
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,670
And we're sinking.

388
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:56,010
By several feet a year.

389
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:00,910
Come see us in five years' time, and the
whole place will be at the bottom of the lake.

390
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,210
News like that isn't exactly
good for the economy.

391
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,810
When it went public,
everyone who could left.

392
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:10,250
The rest of us, well,
we got lonely and sad.

393
00:19:10,930 --> 00:19:12,230
That's when she appeared.

394
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:13,190
Psiren.

395
00:19:13,191 --> 00:19:16,830
Like a lit match on a
fuse, the city burst into life.

396
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:18,630
Reporters came from all over.

397
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:21,430
Tourists flocked here again
for a chance to see her.

398
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,590
Thanks to Psiren, we're having
one last bloom before we drown.

399
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,450
What do you think, brother?

400
00:19:29,150 --> 00:19:31,210
I mean, it kind of makes sense.

401
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:34,850
Maybe Clara really did
become a thief to save the city.

402
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,670
In a different way
than we thought.

403
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,510
Maybe.

404
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,650
I guess the only thing I
can say for sure is this.

405
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,950
She tricked me.

406
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,750
The Full Metal Alchemist.

407
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,230
And she's at least
going to pay for that.

408
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,620
I thought you'd show up.

409
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,280
It's phenomenal, isn't it?

410
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,280
A date here, on the
water, in the moonlight.

411
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,680
Just the two of us.

412
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,460
Shut up, thief.

413
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,600
Oh dear, romance
me with small talk.

414
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:12,180
Yes, a thief.

415
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,400
Someone obsessed with
objects that don't belong to them.

416
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,240
Like the Philosopher's Stone?

417
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,000
Maybe so.

418
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,640
It's funny.

419
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Every crook I meet wants to tell
me how much I'm just like them.

420
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,280
But there's a big difference
between us and the burdens we bear.

421
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,300
Yes, bear.

422
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,080
Love to.

423
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,540
See ya, kid.

424
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,520
I can't breathe.

425
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,020
That was pretty sharp, kid.

426
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm sure you're going
to be a fine grownup.

427
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,920
When you are, let's
do this deal again.

428
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,660
It's always more fun when
it's a woman and a man.

429
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,620
Clara.

430
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,560
But let me offer you one last
little kernel before they haul me off.

431
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,200
About a certain funny stone?

432
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:25,540
Go to the city of Xenotime
and take a good look.

433
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,260
I've heard there's someone there who's
researching the components behind it.

434
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,200
Maybe he could help you out.

435
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,433
Xenotime...

436
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,240
Come on, Al.

437
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,780
Are you still holding
a grudge on me?

438
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,480
I had no choice, you know.

439
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:43,560
I was the officer and
she was the crook.

440
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:44,620
We just played our part.

441
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,460
That's not true.

442
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,280
She's not a crook.

443
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:52,180
You've told me plenty of times that you
can't always go by the rules or follow the rules.

444
00:21:52,181 --> 00:21:54,070
when you're doing what's right.

445
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,920
Clara, she's kind
and giving and heroic.

446
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,400
You think the
same thing, brother.

447
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,960
I'm sure you do.

448
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,080
I don't know, Al.

449
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,700
When it comes to
her, I guess I never will.

450
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,140
Hey, it's an oven in here.

451
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,440
I don't guess you'd
mind unzipping me a little.

452
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:39,650
Full Metal Alchemist.

453
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:40,530
Episode 11.

454
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,690
The Other Brothers Elric Part 1.

455
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,230
Another Brother, Another Me.

456
00:23:47,430 --> 00:23:50,530
And one red stone that
binds us all together.
