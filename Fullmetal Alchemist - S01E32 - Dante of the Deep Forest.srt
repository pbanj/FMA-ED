1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,506
No!

2
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:05,205
Al!!

3
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:11,745
Teacher!

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,455
Teacher!

5
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,385
What's happening?

6
00:00:34,752 --> 00:00:35,497
Al!

7
00:00:39,857 --> 00:00:40,661
Help me.

8
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,835
That right arm of yours
is such a nuisance.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,796
Your brother's gonna
help me crush it into pieces.

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,205
All those ugly mechanical parts.

11
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:53,926
What did you just say?

12
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:57,235
And I'll take
everything you have left.

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,695
No you won't!

14
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:08,965
No Al!

15
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,026
Al Don't!

16
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,475
Brother.

17
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,275
You said a Homunculus
couldn't do alchemy.

18
00:01:23,690 --> 00:01:25,835
But this one's
different somehow.

19
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:29,635
And I think I know what that is.

20
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,915
He can transmute his
body into different materials.

21
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,090
By forming a
circle with its arms.

22
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,675
His left leg and right arm.

23
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,735
Because he's a Homunculus,
he can shape-shift his body.

24
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,875
But the real reason he
can perform alchemy is...

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,735
Because he has both
Edward's lost arm and leg.

26
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:51,855
Impossible.

27
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,855
This power isn't yours.

28
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,715
It was stolen from my brother.

29
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,555
His arm and leg!

30
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,015
Give them back!

31
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,195
Now!

32
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:03,955
No!

33
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:12,395
My turn now!

34
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,055
Brother!

35
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,595
Al, you have to stop this now!

36
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,955
What do you mean?

37
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:21,275
Are you defending
this Homunculus?

38
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,795
He isn't human.

39
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,105
Human or not, he
belongs to Izumi.

40
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,837
So what exactly do
you want edward?

41
00:02:53,861 --> 00:02:55,665
Only what's mine!

42
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,436
This leg was the price you paid.
You got sommething for it didn't you?

43
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:06,516
And in exchange you
got your brothers soul.

44
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:14,505
Tell me, what price are you willing to pay now
to get your limbs back and deprive me of mine.

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,025
Equivalence?

46
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,045
Shut up!

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,285
Ed, no!

48
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,585
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

49
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,245
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

50
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,560
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

51
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:45,905
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one and only truth.

52
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,635
Teacher?

53
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:56,626
You two boys are not
to get involved in this.

54
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,675
I command you.

55
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:00,126
The boy is my sin.

56
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,035
And mine alone to bear.

57
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,735
Teacher!

58
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,095
Not so fast!

59
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:09,709
Winry, make sure Izumi's okay!

60
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:11,586
Hey, wait a minute!

61
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:12,875
She told you guys to stop!

62
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,645
Funny running into you here.

63
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,205
You trained on this island as a
child, isn't that right, Fullmetal?

64
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:36,985
Brother, that woman... That's right,
but what are the two of you doing here?

65
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,125
It seems we're searching
for the same thing.

66
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,985
The Homunculus?

67
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,140
Yes, I've heard that's what
the enemy is calling itself.

68
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,545
Tell me, how much do you boys
really know about this subject?

69
00:06:50,335 --> 00:06:53,105
Do either of you know the reason
they say Homunculus is born?

70
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:59,480
According to ancient alchemic text
and tradition, if the Homunculus actually

71
00:06:59,481 --> 00:07:02,096
exists at all, it's
spawned by an Alchemist.

72
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,325
The unwitting side effect when
someone attempts a human transmutation.

73
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:09,685
Your father wrote about
it in his research as well.

74
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,376
I don't care about him.

75
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,585
My reasons are
no one's business.

76
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,025
Very well.

77
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,956
But if the boy that Lieutenant Colonel
Archer found was really a Homunculus,

78
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,240
that means someone
attempted a human transmutation.

79
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,825
And that is definitely
my business Fullmetal.

80
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,565
Human transmutation
is forbidden.

81
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,525
All culprits will be
punished severely.

82
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,945
Do either of you know
who might have done this?

83
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,085
Shouldn't we be worrying
about the Homunculus?

84
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,085
Our men are
already on his trail.

85
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,325
Sorry, we don't know anything.

86
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,645
Now if you don't
mind, we're in a hurry.

87
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,295
Brother?

88
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,995
We can't let them find
out about Izumi, okay?

89
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,975
I know.

90
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,415
I think we managed to fool them.

91
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:00,895
It wasn't that hard.

92
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,976
Dear Wrath, that
makes all seven of us.

93
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,465
Now I think it's time we
pay the old woman a visit.

94
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,245
Lucky for us, it's close.

95
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,805
I think we need to
talk to her about Greed.

96
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,065
Why Greed?

97
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,285
Because a long time ago,
she's the one who created him.

98
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,025
But why?

99
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,925
Why would you tell
my brother that heresy?

100
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,396
Your brother had a
great thirst for knowledge.

101
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,316
I simply did my
duty to quench it.

102
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,105
Yes, the only thing I did was hand down to
him the ancient memories of our noble people.

103
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,825
Do you know what you've done?

104
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,645
The question is, do you?

105
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:44,276
Never forget, Ishbalan.

106
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,885
Inside here,
they're still alive.

107
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,245
Countless souls waiting.

108
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,416
He's in here!

109
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,105
Look!

110
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,396
Due to circumstances beyond our control,
we were forced to leave our encampments.

111
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:06,605
As the leader of my people, I
accept full responsibility for this.

112
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,796
New residences for you and your people
have been arranged for you in the south.

113
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,665
You will all be
taken there soon.

114
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,205
Tell your people
they are not to resist.

115
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,405
Yes.

116
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:20,705
But before we leave, all of
your people must be registered.

117
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,396
By face and by name.

118
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,225
I see.

119
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,005
You're here on a manhunt.

120
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,085
You may begin.

121
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,865
Do be careful.

122
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,510
I'm sure I saw the homicidal
maniac among the crowd.

123
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,256
I recognized him from
all the wanted posters.

124
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,945
Is the reward still the same?

125
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,525
You had better
not be wrong, Yoki.

126
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,010
Mommy.

127
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,265
Dammit, where is he?

128
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,341
The one with the
X-shaped scar on his face?

129
00:09:48,365 --> 00:09:49,645
I know you're hiding him!

130
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,545
Tell me, you scum!

131
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,845
What's this?

132
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,605
You buffoons better back off!

133
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,665
I'm protected by the...

134
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,845
He's been shot!

135
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,185
But I didn't hear a gun.

136
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,585
Hold.

137
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,765
your fire, you bastards!

138
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,485
Everyone, please, stay calm.

139
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,285
Who shot that man?

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,416
It's all happening again!

141
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,465
Another massacre!

142
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,145
I can't take any more of this!

143
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,285
Yeah, they're right!

144
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,920
I refuse to live in
fear any longer!

145
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,196
Too many of our friends
have been slaughtered!

146
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,825
Death to the military dogs!

147
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,516
Yes!

148
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,205
Come on!

149
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,285
Go back where you came from!

150
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,996
Leave us alone!

151
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:56,625
Take that!

152
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,305
Time for crowd
control, Lieutenant.

153
00:11:03,985 --> 00:11:04,885
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,265
What are you waiting for?

155
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,945
I need you to
cover me right now.

156
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,105
And clean that mess off
your forehead, would you?

157
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,605
Sir!

158
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:28,545
It's a shame when a teacher's
as misguided as her students.

159
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:34,965
Ed, Al, despite my sins,
I have to draw the line.

160
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,965
You can no longer
study under me.

161
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,745
I didn't teach you alchemy so
you could echo my mistakes.

162
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,766
Destroy your own bodies.

163
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,265
Disrupt the world's flow.

164
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,696
I won't stand for
your fighting, either.

165
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,565
But Teach...

166
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,070
We appreciate
all you've taught us.

167
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,339
Please, take care of yourself.

168
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,436
Come on, guys.

169
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,605
This can't be the end.

170
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,933
Are you sure you want to
leave on bad terms like this?

171
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,125
Take care, Sig.

172
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,205
Goodbye, you two.

173
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,125
Make sure to stop by
next time you're here.

174
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:23,025
But... I don't think
we're exactly welcome.

175
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:24,905
Idiots!

176
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:31,345
Now that you boys are no longer Izumi's
students, you're free to start a real relationship with her.

177
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,476
As equals.

178
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,245
That's right!

179
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,671
You don't have to feel
constrained anymore.

180
00:12:35,695 --> 00:12:36,945
She can be your friend now.

181
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,516
Aw, dammit.

182
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,965
Al, we can't leave yet.

183
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:42,885
Okay.

184
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,485
Just watch your head.

185
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,805
Teacher, we need a lead.

186
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,665
I know you can help us return
our bodies to the way they were.

187
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,685
We won't take no for an answer.

188
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,505
Leave!

189
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,065
We're not leaving.

190
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,685
Not without knowing how to get a
Philosopher's Stone without human sacrifice.

191
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,285
It's our only chance.

192
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:02,996
Leave!

193
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,105
We won't leave!

194
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,556
Then I'll cut you up!

195
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,505
Do what you will!

196
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,605
We won't go.

197
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,485
There must be a way for us to send
that Homunculus back to the other side.

198
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,080
That's none of your concern boys.

199
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,885
I told you the child
is my responsibility.

200
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:21,285
We're willing to bear your sins with
you, so you can help us bear ours.

201
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,245
Persistent brats.

202
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,405
You're keeping close
watch on the brothers?

203
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,385
Yes, sir.

204
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:39,865
Keep up the strict surveillance and
inform me of any new developments.

205
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,565
Sir!

206
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,476
You're back to the
Elric brothers, sir?

207
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,605
We've no choice.

208
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,260
I've received reports from Central
that the Führer has in fact traveled south.

209
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:52,405
And is conducting his own
investigation into the Homunculus.

210
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:53,785
That troubles me.

211
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,343
It completely contradicts
what we were told yesterday.

212
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:02,137
So if the Führer has made it his direct
responsibility to capture the fugitive Homunculus.

213
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:07,465
Then we have to make it our highest priority to
be aware of every move the Elric brothers make.

214
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,676
Because there's a chance they'll
lead us right to another Chimera.

215
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,465
And Kimbley too.

216
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,045
Let's go.

217
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,625
I've got a bad feeling
about this place.

218
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,536
Oh yeah?

219
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,207
What's that?

220
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,916
You guys... go back to the
Devil's Nest and wait for me.

221
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,176
You're not going out
there alone, are you?

222
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,045
I'm just curious
about something.

223
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:58,015
Very well. Al, you say you have no
memory of the other side of the gate, correct?

224
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,175
That's right.

225
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,655
Then maybe your body's still
there along with your memories.

226
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,250
But it sure won't be
easy to retrieve them now.

227
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:07,926
Of course it won't,
but we're up to the task.

228
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:11,046
With the Philosopher's Stone, we
may be able to open the gate again.

229
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,615
But this time, ignore the
principle of equivalent exchange.

230
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:16,437
Equivalency.

231
00:15:18,355 --> 00:15:21,335
Tell me, do you really
believe in that principle, Ed?

232
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,075
Of course he does.

233
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:25,955
To obtain something of
equal value must be lost.

234
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,575
It's not just the law of alchemy,
it's the way everything in life works.

235
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,155
You do a great job reciting it.

236
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:35,226
But my son lost his
life before he was born.

237
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,675
And what did he get in return?

238
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,606
Absolutely nothing.

239
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,175
There was no equivalency.

240
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,315
Apparently, I'm not
much of a teacher after all.

241
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:47,995
Mason!

242
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:48,895
Yes!

243
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,475
Show them the way
to Dante's house.

244
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,915
They're making a trip there
tomorrow to pick up my medicine.

245
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,466
Enjoy the trip, boys.

246
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,975
It should be educational.

247
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:04,383
I wonder what Dante
is going to be like.

248
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,655
According to Mason, she's a
world-renowned pharmacist.

249
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,235
Brother, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

250
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,666
If it's true that a Homunculus is created
from failed human transmutation the... Come on, Al.

251
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,595
Pick up the pace.

252
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:22,815
Hello?

253
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:23,735
Anybody home?

254
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,215
We've been expecting you,
Dante's anxious to meet you both.

255
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:31,935
What?

256
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,135
I know you!

257
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,375
Lyra!

258
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,295
I apologize for my
actions when we last met.

259
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,795
What are you doing here?

260
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,895
Dante was kind enough to let
me stay here as her apprentice.

261
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,255
One day, I hope to be a
great Alchemist just like her.

262
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:53,986
Wait a minute.

263
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,915
I didn't know Dante
was an Alchemist.

264
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,995
The best.

265
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,690
And after I met you two boys in
Youswell, I knew I had to improve my skills.

266
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,296
And be a master Alchemist.

267
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,035
Well, you've sure done a 180.

268
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:07,715
It's open.

269
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,455
The Elric brothers have arrived.

270
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:15,655
I've been waiting for you,
Edward and Alphonse Elric.

271
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,595
So you're Dante, are you?

272
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,046
That's right.

273
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:21,335
And you two must be
Izumi's great apprentices.

274
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,755
I've heard what's going on.

275
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:27,066
Come with me, and I'll make a
fresh batch of medicine for her.

276
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:27,955
I'm sorry.

277
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,935
What's your
relationship with Izumi?

278
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:30,610
Simple.

279
00:17:30,611 --> 00:17:33,566
She was my apprentice
many, many years ago.

280
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,135
I'm the one who
taught her alchemy.

281
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,395
I didn't know that.

282
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,115
Yes.

283
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:39,815
So that means you're
our teacher's teacher.

284
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,955
Yes, I suppose so.

285
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,955
I'll be damned.

286
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,895
How did I ever get so lucky?

287
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:52,735
I just stopped by to see an old friend,
and who should I find in her mansion?

288
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:56,535
Well, as long as I'm here,
I should have some fun.

289
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,030
You can't be serious.

290
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:02,035
You're a fellow State Alchemist.

291
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,437
Tell me you don't want it, too.

292
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,015
We just got a
message from Greed.

293
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,635
He's got a job for us.

294
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,875
Why don't you think
it over for a while?

295
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,395
Dante, if I may ask, what made
you want to become an Alchemist?

296
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,775
A number of reasons.

297
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:31,895
Maybe it's foolish, but the most
important reason is I wanted to help people.

298
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,355
Humans need alchemy
more than they'll ever know.

299
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:42,435
That doesn't mean alchemy is necessary for life,
but it can provide valuable relief to those who need it.

300
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,995
And I enjoy making people happy,
rewarding them for their hard efforts in life.

301
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,695
Providing a
balance, if you would.

302
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:52,795
Equivalency.

303
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,126
That's right.

304
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:59,255
He can only achieve happiness who
puts forth an equal amount of work.

305
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:01,075
No greater truth.

306
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:09,435
Dante, what do you think
about the Philosopher's Stone?

307
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,635
Why?

308
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,715
Are you two looking for it?

309
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:16,955
N..No, I was just curious.

310
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,346
Everyone who's gone looking for the stone
has found nothing but unhappiness in the end.

311
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:26,635
I wonder if mankind truly is ready
to possess such a powerful thing.

312
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,795
You really look
like your father, Ed.

313
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,490
I know.

314
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:33,615
I knew him very well.

315
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:37,575
Hohenheim of Light, he sought
after the Philosopher's Stone as well.

316
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,195
Tell us more.

317
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:43,375
Do you know where
your father's living now?

318
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,635
I don't care.

319
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,495
Brother.

320
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,825
They're separated.

321
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,785
Great.

322
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,285
Handle it just like we planned.

323
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,685
Nice and easy.

324
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,765
Let's go.

325
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,005
Time for fun.

326
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,845
It's you again!

327
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,085
Damn you!

328
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,465
You surprised?

329
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,385
I call it the Ultimate Shield.

330
00:20:46,901 --> 00:20:47,325
Lyra?

331
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,285
LYra!

332
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,285
Don't move.

333
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,425
We have no intention of harming
you or the old lady if you cooperate, kid.

334
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,105
Dante!

335
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,085
Hello.

336
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,325
Who are you guys?

337
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,125
We're kidnappers.

338
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,505
Who are you kidnapping?

339
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,960
You, Alphonse Elric.

340
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,105
I'm sorry, but you're going
to have to come with us now.

341
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,865
But my teacher taught me never
to go anywhere with strangers.

342
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,205
Don't be ridiculous.

343
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,565
How old are you?

344
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,645
Fourteen.

345
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:26,305
If you're that old, you should be able to
think and act for yourself by now, am I right?

346
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,396
Listen, kid.

347
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:31,165
If you ever want to be a man,
then you gotta act like one.

348
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,425
You can't let your teacher
run your life forever, right?

349
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,476
Right.

350
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,120
I should think for myself.

351
00:21:38,121 --> 00:21:39,345
Now you're talking.

352
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,036
Then we're clear.

353
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:48,185
You're gonna come with U...
I decided not to go with strangers.

354
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,025
That's my decision
and mine alone.

355
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,825
