# FMA-ED

Proper english subtitles(dubtitles) for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) English dub.

Once I finish all the episodes I'll make an actual release. 

I do these in my spare time. Each episode takes about an hour or so to do each one.  

They're synced to my personal copies so you may need to resync them to yours.  


THESE SUBTITLES MAY NOT BE UPLOADED TO OPENSUBTITLES.ORG/COM OR ANY OTHER TLD THEY MAY USE.
