Proper english subtitles(dubtitles) for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) English dub & the Conqueror of Shamballa movie.

~~Once I finish all the episodes I'll make an actual release.~~

1.0 Release Day \o/ 12/25/2025. My X-Mas gift to all was to get these done for today. Sorry it took so long, I almost died a couple times.
