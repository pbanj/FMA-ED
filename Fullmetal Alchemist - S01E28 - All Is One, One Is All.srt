1
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:10,300
This is a joke.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,100
What does she
mean, cool our heads?

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,480
I hope she doesn't think we're gonna
have any trouble surviving here now.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:21,420
She even forbade us
from using alchemy.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,260
It's just like last
time, isn't it?

6
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,280
Yeah, really.

7
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,152
I mean, what's the
point of doing this again?

8
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:27,960
Does teacher think we
haven't grown up at all?

9
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,140
Oh, I don't know.

10
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,180
I'm sure she has her reasons.

11
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,360
No, wait!

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:36,940
Go back!

13
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:37,680
Edward!

14
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:38,600
Alphonse!

15
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,720
Don't move around, girl.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,920
You'll get wet.

17
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,560
Okay.

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,400
But what do you want them to do?

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,220
I don't want them
to do anything.

20
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,360
That's right.

21
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,740
What's right?

22
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:54,240
You left them on an uninhabited
island without any provisions.

23
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,675
And what do you mean you
don't want them to do anything?

24
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:58,460
I mean just that.

25
00:00:59,340 --> 00:00:59,860
Right.

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,080
You know...

27
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,480
I just don't think I
understand you people at all.

28
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,483
It's okay to do nothing.

29
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,760
It's alright to just stop and
think things over for a while.

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,900
Those two need some
time to do that right now.

31
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,710
Humankind cannot gain anything
without first giving something in return.

32
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,390
To obtain, something of
equal value must be lost.

33
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:29,870
That is alchemy's first
law of equivalent exchange.

34
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:36,350
In those days, we really believed
that to be the world's one, and only truth.

35
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,670
Al... let's escape.

36
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:23,270
Ah!

37
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,890
That's impossible!

38
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,090
I can't swim!

39
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:29,619
Come to think
about it, neither can I.

40
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,630
Yeah, we're different
from back then.

41
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,910
We're smarter.

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,880
This is fun, isn't it, brother?

43
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:46,840
You bet.

44
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:50,660
It has been a long time since we
went on a vacation together, huh, Al?

45
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,160
A vacation?

46
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,600
Good one!

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,160
Here, take this.

48
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,440
A knife?

49
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,460
This is an uninhabited island.

50
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:19,200
There's no electricity, no Wells, no
house to protect you from the rain.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,000
As for wild animals,
there probably aren't any.

52
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,125
You two have to survive on this island all
by yourselves for one full month, all right?

53
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:32,520
Oh, and you can't
use any alchemy.

54
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,700
What?!

55
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,840
I'll come to pick you up
in a month, okay, boys?

56
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
What?!

57
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:40,121
Wa... Wait!

58
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,100
One is all, and all is one.

59
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,986
Oh, and boys, if you still haven't figured that out by
the end of the month, I'm sending you back to Risembool.

60
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:50,920
Bye!

61
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,420
One is all, and all is one.

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:07,300
We understand the concept now, but back then...
Yeah, we had no idea what she meant by it back then.

63
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:08,780
Man, were we dumb.

64
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,180
One is all, and all is one, huh?

65
00:05:24,935 --> 00:05:27,380
Damn, that crazy lady sure
gave us some weird homework.

66
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,740
It doesn't make any sense.

67
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,620
Yeah, one is all,
and all is one?

68
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,500
What's that mean?

69
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,140
Maybe it's a riddle.

70
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,960
It sounds pretty stupid to me.

71
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah, but she said if we don't find the answer
to it in a month, we can't go through real training.

72
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:48,120
We were tricked into coming to this
island by that crazy, sadistic witch!

73
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,640
What the hell does this have
to do with alchemy anyway?!

74
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,400
Let's sleep.

75
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,280
We'll have to get up early
tomorrow to look for something to eat.

76
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:00,120
Yeah.

77
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,510
What's up, Al?

78
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,230
Need a restroom?

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
What is it, brother?

80
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,420
Go to the bathroom by yourself.

81
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,045
You idiot!

82
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,680
Wake up!

83
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,260
Wake up!

84
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,800
Get out of here!

85
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:03,530
We can't get out of here!

86
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,670
If we leave now, we'll
never learn anything!

87
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:06,338
Brother!

88
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,090
Damn it!

89
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,430
Alphonse!

90
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,850
Damn it!

91
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,350
Alphonse!

92
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:40,490
Run!

93
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:00,780
Oh, man.

94
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,260
You better not be lost
or I'll kill you myself!

95
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,240
Al!

96
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:04,980
Al!

97
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,240
You don't want to eat me!

98
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,980
I take terrible!

99
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,520
Brother, it's just me!

100
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,180
Oh, Al!

101
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,280
I'm so glad it's you!

102
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,680
I was afraid you got lost!

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Look, it's a fox.

104
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,760
There's two of them.

105
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,020
Well, how'd it go?

106
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,960
Let's check.

107
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,090
All right!

108
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:22,510
We got ourselves some dinner!

109
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,450
Don't forget to
dry yourself off.

110
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,750
You don't want to rust.

111
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:26,290
Okay.

112
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,270
Who was that person, brother?

113
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:29,490
Oh, man.

114
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,490
He's so scary.

115
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,790
She said there
were no wild animals.

116
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,090
I think he was more
dangerous than any wild animal.

117
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,510
What should we do?

118
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,110
What can we do?

119
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:42,490
Our ride's not coming
for another month.

120
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,950
First thing's first.

121
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,250
If we're both hungry,
then we can't fight.

122
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:48,530
Yes!

123
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:50,870
My brother is a genius!

124
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,830
Looks like these traps work
even if you don't make them right.

125
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:58,950
So, how are we supposed
to eat that brother?

126
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,190
We kill it.

127
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,610
Do we have to?

128
00:10:14,231 --> 00:10:14,750
You do it.

129
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,150
No, you don't understand Ed.

130
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:18,930
You have to do it.

131
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:19,950
There's no way I can.

132
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:21,356
I've never killed
an animal before.

133
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,070
Well, I haven't either, Al!

134
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,190
But that's no fair!

135
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:26,206
You always make
me do your dirty work!

136
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:26,950
I do not!

137
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:28,290
Ah!

138
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:28,850
Ah!

139
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:30,850
Stop!

140
00:10:31,110 --> 00:10:31,510
Stop!

141
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:35,311
That's our rabbit!

142
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,620
Brother!

143
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,900
Are you okay?

144
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,380
That bite looks bad.

145
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,660
That stupid fox!

146
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:59,050
When we find that damn
thing, I'm biting it back!

147
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:00,650
Brother!

148
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,740
It has babies.

149
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,960
I guess she's the mother.

150
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:13,940
Mm-hmm.

151
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,100
Let's pass on the meat
and eat fish instead.

152
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:40,430
I'm starting to wonder
if foxes are edible.

153
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,910
Just be patient, Ed.

154
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:44,710
Got one!

155
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,750
Fire!

156
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,070
Time to eat!

157
00:11:50,294 --> 00:11:51,194
Food!!

158
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:14,190
Almost ready.

159
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:26,520
Brother!

160
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:27,040
Yeah?

161
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:27,660
What's up?

162
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,060
Come with me.

163
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:30,420
Ow!

164
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,820
What happened here?

165
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,700
What do you mean, what happened?

166
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,500
You got hungry and ate
it all before dinner time.

167
00:12:37,501 --> 00:12:38,900
It wasn't me.

168
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,320
But look, there's
your handprint.

169
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,020
Look at it carefully.

170
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,640
It's a right hand.

171
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,180
So someone else is here.

172
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,180
Someone else?

173
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,680
You mean...

174
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,080
Well, at least now we know
why Teacher brought us here.

175
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:56,200
She thinks we didn't
get enough the last time.

176
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,780
Wait, where are you going?

177
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:00,585
To find the masked man.

178
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,860
We might as well go ahead
and get this over with now.

179
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,860
We're not giving
up that easy, Al.

180
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,100
One month.

181
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,540
I think we can hack it.

182
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,700
Hey.

183
00:14:08,324 --> 00:14:11,824
So why are we here again Al?
I don't remember.

184
00:14:12,348 --> 00:14:13,348
Me either.

185
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,220
What would happen if we died
here before she came back for us?

186
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,240
We can't!

187
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,040
Winry and Aunt
Pinako would be sad.

188
00:14:40,150 --> 00:14:43,120
And there are so many things I
haven't done yet that I want to do.

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,240
It's just that I... I
don't understand.

190
00:14:46,241 --> 00:14:48,020
And what this has
to do with alchemy.

191
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:49,600
I hate this.

192
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,660
I want to go home.

193
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,520
All right.

194
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,240
Where are you?

195
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,320
Food for Brother.

196
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,680
Brother, look what I found.

197
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,380
Hey, what's up with him?

198
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,620
Did you call me?

199
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:26,968
Brother!

200
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,900
Then... who was that over there?

201
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,100
The cicada...

202
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,680
I see...

203
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,680
It died.

204
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:15,604
Death.

205
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,750
If we die...

206
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,440
The same thing
will happen to us.

207
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:27,860
It died...

208
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,780
Let go of him!

209
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,020
Let go... of my brother...

210
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,360
We talked about what would
happen if we died here... Remember?

211
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,480
Yeah.

212
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,160
A lot of people would be sad.

213
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,220
That's a subjective opinion.

214
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,460
But look at it objectively.

215
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,880
If I die, the world would continue to
move along as if nothing had happened.

216
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,460
Because you're
just a small part of it.

217
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,180
Don't call me small.

218
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:40,520
Well, when the small part, in this
case me, dies, the body remains.

219
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:48,160
Water, carbon, ammonia, lime,
phosphorus, salt, saltpeter, sulfur, magnesium,

220
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,840
fluorine, iron, and
aluminum, right?

221
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:51,220
Right.

222
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,760
The body's only a combination
of those simple elements.

223
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:55,960
Nothing more.

224
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,583
We are destined to be decomposed by
bacteria and become nutrients for plants.

225
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,340
Then you follow
the process further.

226
00:18:05,925 --> 00:18:08,380
Those plants nourish herbivores.

227
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,600
And those herbivores
nourish carnivores.

228
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,100
Even others like us.

229
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:17,540
And though we lose awareness, our
lives keep moving through the system.

230
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,360
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:25,840
The great flow that
maintains the universe.

232
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,060
Call it the cycle of life.

233
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,720
The course of nature.

234
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,480
Each of us is just a
small part of that current.

235
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,300
One in the all.

236
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:40,460
And yet, without all the
individual ones, the all can't exist.

237
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,320
This world flows by following
grander laws we can't even imagine.

238
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,340
To recognize that flow.

239
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,900
And work within it.

240
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,080
To decompose.

241
00:18:50,081 --> 00:18:51,220
And recreate.

242
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,820
That is alchemy.

243
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,940
28 days.

244
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,760
And hey, we got some breakfast.

245
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,380
All right, boys.

246
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,320
Let's hear it.

247
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,720
What does it mean that
one is all and all is one?

248
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,820
The world is the
all and I am the one.

249
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:13,755
Hm?

250
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,380
Hm.

251
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,260
Hm?

252
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,080
All right then...

253
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,280
Let's begin your training.

254
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:27,840
Whaaa?

255
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:29,460
Yeahhhh.

256
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:37,296
I guess we aren't gonna
find the guy in the mask.

257
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:38,400
What's it matter?

258
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,100
We already learned the only lesson
this island has to teach us, right?

259
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:42,940
Yeah.

260
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:47,600
When we were kids... we taught ourselves
the answer to one is all and all is one.

261
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,640
We didn't understand
everything that meant.

262
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,600
It was a mistake to
try to bring Mom back.

263
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,840
We learned that the hard way.

264
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:59,000
The cycle of life only
goes one direction.

265
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,700
Not even alchemy
can change that.

266
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,680
I guess Teacher brought
us here to remind us of that.

267
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,480
And to give us time to think
about the consequences.

268
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,620
Well, did you remember?

269
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,420
Yes.

270
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,160
And did you realize?

271
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,640
Teacher, we know what
you're trying to tell us.

272
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:40,080
It's true that we went against the laws of
alchemy when we tried to bring our Mom back.

273
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,420
What you see before you
is our punishment for that.

274
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,400
But we just want to regain the bodies
we lost when we made that mistake.

275
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,580
Are you trying to regain something you lost
because of a mistake by making another one?

276
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,020
We know it's not
what you taught us.

277
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,400
But we... we... We
have to try, dammit.

278
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,020
We can't just give up.

279
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:10,640
Even though we may not have
been able to... to bring Mom back.

280
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,280
We are still alive.

281
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,860
So you're determined
to move forward?

282
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,840
Yes, ma'am.

283
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,130
So be it.

284
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,370
Is there someone out there?

285
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,010
What are you talking about?

286
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,270
Of course there is.

287
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,650
Somebody was on the
island when we were kids, too.

288
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,490
We figured it was just the same
guy in the mask from before.

289
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,090
Impossible.

290
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,289
Since I was the brute
in the mask back then.

291
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,370
Wait a minute!

292
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:40,766
That was you the whole time?

293
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:41,230
Yes.

294
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:43,370
I sent him to make
sure you didn't die.

295
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,010
But he nearly killed us!

296
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:49,450
It looks like we don't have
time to discuss this right now.

297
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:40,717
Fullmetal Alchemist

298
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:42,670
Episode 29 The Untainted child.

299
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:45,966
I saw it, brother.

300
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:48,250
The scar on his
shoulder looks familiar.

301
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:50,570
Who is this boy?
